\section*{INTERPRETATION}
\begin{itemize}
\item PCV and customer satisfaction are negatively correlated. This indicates as customer perceives more PCV, his satisfaction gets affected.
\item Service performance is negatively correlated with overall service. This indicates overall service doesn't depend on service performance. 
\item Overall service has a correlation with customer satisfaction. As overall service increases, customer satisfaction tends to increase.
\item Customer satisfaction and loyalty are postively correlated. This indicates a satisfied customer will be more loyal to the bank and spreads word of mouth.
\item R squared value for HO is 0.407 at 95\% significance level.
\item R squared value for H1 is 0.554 at 95\% significance level.
\item R squared value for H2 is 0.9 at 95\% significance level.
\item R squared value for H3 is 0.157 at 95\% significance level.
