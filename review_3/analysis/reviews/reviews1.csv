"Aug 24, 05 1:02",24/08/05,"I've been a customer of STATE BANK OF TRAVANCORE since the late 80's. I have had accounts with SBT at six of its branches so far, as I had to change my residence according to my father's transfers, my education and my own job. All these years I find the bank's service and facilities quite satisfactory. I can't recollect a situation which make me speak against SBT. I should say that I get a feeling of being at home when I visit an SBT branch. The bank really care for its customers and serve them sincerely, from my experience. There can be exceptions, of course. But after being a part of the bank for about 17 years I don't have the slightest of hesitation to recommend it to anyone. I have been with the bank before and after the boom of private banks, and I observe that SBT has adapted reasonably well to technological innovations in banking. Being a component of the STATE BANK GROUP, the largest network in India, their ATM coverage is exceptional. SBT has more than 670 branches in all, the majority of them in Kerala.",4,1
"Dec 26, 06 11:28",26/12/06,"I am with this bank since year 2000. This bank started at Rajeshwari Nagar in the year 2000.

This bank was working on Sundays when they opened it but now since 2 years they have stopped working on Sundays.

Since year 2000, this bank has changed the account numbers thrice, which means they changed our Savings Bank account number thrice because they upgraded to computerized branch.

Tough its computerized branch, people working here are of my fathers age and have very less knowledge about computers.

Many times when I go to get entries on my passbook, the staff gives a lame excuse as Printer not working or computer not working.

Let me tell you the disadvantages of this Branch which is at Rajeshwari Nagar.



Does not work on Sundays.



No proper staffing



Computers not working most of the time.



Printers not working most of the time.



No security guard at ATM, any one can leave the door open or anyone can go in and sleep in the AC during summer.



This branch does not issue Stamp Papers, we have to go all the way to Mysore Road, BHEL branch which opens at 10:30AM.





Only advantage of this branch is that its near to my house.

If State Banks has to improve then they should first change the staff to educated ones who know computers.

Should recruit people who have good education and merit and not by caste.

Banking with State Banks is simple, suitable for housewives, less educated individuals and my mother of course.

State Banks are not suitable for Business people, Corporate, Software/Call center Employees.",1,-2
"Aug 6, 07 12:53",06/08/07,"In todays Indian financial market we rarely consider PSU banks when opening a new account- its assumed that their service is bad and only the nimble private sector banks can meet changing consumer preferences. As I discovered, nothing can be farther from truth.

I opened my first bank account with UCO bank and then moved on to HDFC Bank, HSBC bank and Citibank before settling with ICICI bank. However, two years back, I had to open an account with state bank of Travancore because I took a loan from them in kerala(Kunnamangalam branch). Let me accept that I had never expected the service levels that I actually got. Obviously, when I shifted to Mumbai sometimes back, I decided to continue the account in Fort branch in Mumbai. I observed many things about SBT which make banking with them a pleasure. Here is a summary:

1. Honest bank: I find SBT completely honest and transparent. Not even one paisa has ever been debited from my account without explanations. The minimum quarterly balance required is only 1000 Rs and then also penalty for failing to maintain the balance is only 300 Rs.

2. Best deals:Terms of their loans are unbeatable. I havent found even a single person who took a loan with me and got a better deal. I would suggest that you compare their rates with your banks rates before taking a loan.

3. Flexibility:Now, thats something totally surprising because I had always associated PSU banks with government like work culture. But I found SBT much more flexible then any bank I had dealt with earlier.(See point 6 about withdrawing money without passbook.)

4. Personal service:Not only in Kerala but also in Mumbai I have got such high levels of personalized service that is possibly not available to even priority banking customers of many banks. Consider this- I have direct phone numbers of people I deal with and not even once someone has not received my call or not solved any problem then and there. Contrast that with frustrating call centers of private banks!

5. Fast service: I have been to ICICI branches many times. The truth is I dread going there and when it is necessary to visit a branch I allow for at least three hours even for small requests.(Remember the tokens and huge queues?). I have visited SBT at least hundred times and walked to the concerned persons every single time without any significant waiting time. In any case, branch manager is very helpful and always willing to solve any problems.

6. Trust and respect for customer:One day I lost my wallet in local train and urgently needed money after I reached my office. I did not have debit card, cheque book or the passbook. Is it possible to withdraw money in such situations from a private bank? I dont know because I did not even try. I called SBT and told them what had happened. They immediately blocked my debit card. Later, when I went to the bank they reapplied for new debit card and allowed me to withdraw money without any hassles. Why? Because employees there know me personally even though I have visited the branch only twice!(By the way, I am a very small account holder.)

7. Best ATM network: I travel a lot. However, no matter where I am I always find a state bank ATM near me unlike other banks that open ATMs only in metros. Since any state bank customer can use any other state bank ATM for free, that counts to a huge number considering that only SBI has more than 5000 AMTs. Add to that the ATMs of state bank subsidiaries like SBT. Naturally, the State bank ATMs are less crowded!

8. Knowledgeable People:Employees in SBT branches have been in business for quite some time and they really know banking. So, I have been saved the frustration of explaining complicated issues to freshers with little understanding of banking.

9. Superior processes: When I wanted internet banking facility in my account I thought it will take at least a week to get the internet login and password. But when I visited the branch, they gave me id and password then and there instead of taking down the request and mailing it to me later! In fact, in every aspect I find systems and processes of SBT more user friendly then other banks. Even in ATMs they have provided swipe system which means your ATM card never gets struck in the machine. Thats saves a lot of hassles- doesnt it?

So, is everything good about SBT? Of course, not. If you are looking for swanky branches with AC, sofa and smiling girls you wont find that in SBT. But I prefer to finish my work quickly and leave rather than to wait for long hours in AC. The humble fan works just fine for me.

Conclusion: If you want no nonsense high quality banking head for SBT, for everything else you can always check out private and foreign banks!

Desclaimer: I do am not associated with SBT in any way except that I have been their customer for last two years. I have written only for the benefit of the visitors to the website without any intention to show any other bank in negative light.",5,2
"Mar 12, 08 10:02",12/03/08,"""How pleasant."" were the first words which I uttered after we came out of Nerul, Navi Mumbai based SBT branch.One year ago we had gone there to open a saving bank account.Not only did I find the staff(right from gurad to the manager(who personally helped us with information) polite and friendly but also very professional in helping me out with our querries. Offering a variety of standard banking as well as investment services, this is a bank just like any other banking institution; yet the staff has made it's ambience so amiable that it's no longer ""only a bank"" but ""the bank"" for score of its customers like me.

With my one year of dealing with the bank's staff, I have found them remarkably behaving like a bank interested in helping numerous customers like me genuinly. Its highly remarkable in era where banks are vying for wide customerbase by behaving more and more like a marketing institution right from designing their building's ambience to unwelcomingly imposing mountain of information on public.

The location where bank is located is easily accessible and offers people living in CBD Belapur, SeaWoods Estate as well as Nerul an easy accessibility.The presence of an ATM just outside the branch makes life further simpler. While the bank is connected through internet to a nationwide SBI network offers the comfort of banking from home. Always eager to help, every visit to the bank is as welcoming as the first one which is memorable.

With variety of services under one roof, the bank offers a friendly ambience to help customers decide their investment as well as saving.Informative staff adds on to the advantage of not only the bank but also to public.

On a typical day when due to a technological snag I raised an inquiry with the bank manager which even he was unable to answer, he was humble enough to accept his ignorance and surprisingly placed an outstation call to a fellow manager in one of the other branches to find out the details.I was in for a pleasant surprise when he not only provided me information but also thanked him for helping him increase his knowledge base.

I wonder in today's metro life where there's a breed of people who treat work as a burden, there still exists another who cherish what they are doing and help make society a less complex place to exist.",5,2
"May 3, 08 9:14",03/05/08,"My self and and my wife went and opened an S/B account in Pappanamcode Branch here in Trivandrum. This was one of the nearest banks near my residence(1 1/2 Km).

Though I heard of horror stories of SBT service in Trivandrum( 2 hours to issue a DD, careless replies across the counter, total lack of professionalism in service), I saw the reviews here and took the plunge.

but I forgot one aspect that all the reviews here pertain to branches outside Kerala. Inside Kerala, somehow the don't care attitude towards customer still persists(It is not only banks, you go to any service related aspect, KSRTC, EB, University, even textile shops!). This did not strike me at that time.

I applied for ATM card also. I was told that the card will reach in 15 days time, but even after 40 days it did not reach me.

I called there customer service(toll free line 1800 112211)and the person  told that no details are with him and he cannot help. After one hour again I called and told the same problem to a different person. He told me that my account number is wrong and I have to confirm the number with the branch. I called the branch. The ""concerned Officer""  told me that the card should have come and the branch will not know whether a card is sent to customer. He told me that  I have to check with Post office whether such a card came in my name and returned back. Then if I provide that information only then he will ""think"" of doing something in this matter.

I again called up the toll free number and told that the account number is correct and whether he can help me in this regard. He coolly replies that he does not have any information and he cannot help. Then I asked him to take my phone call as a complaint and forward it to the concerned branch for further action. but he told that I have to complain to the branch, the branch will give him information and then he will provide details to me. I asked him If I have to go to branch to complain, what for he is sitting there as the customer service executive. He flatly refused to co operate and declined to provide any further help.

Now I feel that I should have listened to my Gut instincts and should have never opened an account with them.

Some members here posted some email ID's with regard to ICICI bank to which if we write complaints to, positive action  will  emerge. Is there some thing similar for SBT?

If this is the attitude of SBT, God help the bank",1,-2
"May 14, 09 2:53",14/05/09,"I'm operating my SB account since 2007, also have taken home loan from State Bank of Mysore - Thiruvanmiyur Branch, Chennai.

Very close to Thiruvanmiyur bus terminus, so it is easy for me to reach the bank.

They pay very good attn at customers. Normally, waiting period is the major concern in banks, which is very very less with SBM. There is no need to search for the managers cabin, it is just on the entrance, yu can reach easily. Ofcource you may not need it, since all the staffs are attentive to the customer requests and fast in response.

I have not uesed their ATM, phone banking and internet banking services, but hope it will be at par with any other banking co, since many banks are converging and sharing their service, so must meet some standards. The infrastructure looks old, but not yet faced any issues with them so far.

"Aug 3, 09 10:25",03/08/09,"Recently went to SBT bank in Bangalore for a housing loan, I was shocked to see their performance, they were really good. The guy whom I had to meet for the home loan was really genuine & took all the time to help me with the all the information.

Like other banks (ICICI) he dint try to sell any other thing, he was only talking about the Home Loan & no insurance policy or Mutual Fund nonsense.

He collected all the documents patiently & looked into each & everything with due deligence. Gave me approximate time-frame & you wont believe all this was done in flat 15 mins.

No waiting, no queues no nonsense just plain banking. My loan is stil not approved but I am really thinking of closing my ICIC A/c & moving to SBT. Its really good. It would suggest everyone to open an account with them",5,2
"Oct 1, 09 12:24",01/10/09,"SBT is one of the oldest bank in our state and lot & lot of customers with it. I have deposited 1000 rupees from sreekaryam branch ( I dont have A/C with the branch) to my friend's A/C on Paipra branch. The cashier asked me to give extra 25Rs to him.

I asked where to enter the amount and he replied just give to him. I give him the extra amount without any proof. After core banking, I think there wasnt any charges like this for transfering money from one branch to another. Even if there is a charge why he cant give me a reciept for it?

I have used ICICI Bank & HDFC bank so many times, even for transfering money from one state to another, they haven't yet asked this sort of charges. Is there any charges for the transfer unlike other banks or Is he asked a sort of bribe? If so where to complaint?",1,-2
"Mar 26, 10 10:02",26/03/10,"In my opinion it is very good bank. I have got good experience in getting car loan within hours.  They told what they require for loan at one stroke and I submitted and the loan was sanctioned with in hours,  it is astonishing.

I recommend that bank to all of you. If you want any type of loan don't hesitate to approaching sbh. You will get best price and best product and also prompt service. U wont find such a best bank in your area. No 1 in forefront of service.They have got not of products which suits your requirement.  If you have a dream they have a scheme.

Kindly approach sbh for your banking needs and get them fulfilled.",5,2
"Apr 21, 10 5:36",21/04/10,"I have been associated with this bank as long as I remember. Both my parents were working in SBT and now they have retired. I have my savings account in this bank since childhood. But this bank also has the dubious reputation of not being responsive to the customers. Why I am saying this is inspite of my dad knowing a lot of people in SBT it took almost a month for my housing loan to get sanctioned. They were asking one paper after another. The thing that irritated me the most was after 3 weeks when I contacted them regarding the status of my loan they said I am yet to submit 1 paper. This they haven't told me earlier or I would have submitted. By that time the builder was asking for payments. Finally my dad had to run pillar to post to get our loan sanctioned on time. This kind of service irrespective of being a retired SBT senior manager's daughter. So I don't know how it will be with people who don't have any contacts in SBT.

True the delays were really irritating, but still for taking loans I would prefer this bank compared to HDFC and ICICI. Reason being their process is transperant. All the details of the money u need to pay is documented. Though in private banks loans get sanctioned fast if their process is not transperant and there will be hidden charges here and there.

I guess if SBT can improve their customer service. remove the huge paperwork and inordinate delays it will have more customers. People prefer nationalized banks for loans. It is just that the paperwork and delay that is keeping them away. SBT needs to understand this and make improvements in their customer service accordingly. Currently it has the largest number of branches in kerala and wide ATM network. Their rural reach in Kerala is much better than other banks. They need to capitalize on this strength with improved customer service to become a truly a bank of choice.",3,0
"Jun 27, 10 12:03",27/06/10,"No negatives at all. Good trust, & good technologies. More branches.good atm service, mobile banking, internet banking, & employees know more about banking than any other bank's staffs. I closed my union bank account & opened a new account in sbt frm 1995 onwards.now i am proud to be a customer in sbt.they keep a long tradition of trust with we malayalees.

When we have any doubt.just have to call the branch only. Even the boys sitting in counters know much than the managers of icici, hdfc & south indian bank.

Also no hidden charges at all.

Our money is safe in sbt.",5,2
"Mar 5, 11 2:58",05/03/11,"I recommend SBT only if you are using their branch networks and ATM for your banking needs. I had a horrible experience in setting up my internet banking. The kit provided from branch never worked and I was never able to login the initial username and password combination. However the third kit worked!

Another problem is with fund transfer. As an added security measure each time you perform a fund transfer to third party, an sms is sent to your mobile with a pin. This pin is required to complete the online third party fund transfer. Imagine if you are overseas and If you are not using International Roaming, you simply cannot perform this operation. There are other advanced ways of implementing security and I do not consider password+ sms Pin combination as an ideal solution.

I also joined a super surplus account with the bank - this is a variable recurring deposit scheme where you can set a base amount and invest up to 10 times the base amount each month subject to a single deposit per month. However after couple of months, I found out that the maturity amount in your account is always based on the base amount you have chosen initially. This doesn't change even though you make regular remittances each month. Finally you will reach a stage where your actual balance in the account is much higher than the calculated Maturity Amount shown in the portal.

In summary, I recommend SBT for IN BRANCH Banking and ATM networks, but not at all ideal for people who depend mainly on internet banking. There are more software glitches in the portal, and better they fix it. Customer complaints raised from internet banking portal are never answered. Branch Managers are welcoming and want to establish a personal relationship with you.but the technology is spoiling this relationship and Managers are helpless!",1,-2
"Mar 7, 11 5:54",07/03/11,"I am tempted to post my comments on SBT's performance after reading the reviews of Mira Gopal and Deeb.  A Bank's customer service cannot be judged by the poor response of a couple of its Branches.  My experience with SBT's Pune (Deccan Gymkhana) Branch on our housing loan application was overwhelming.  In June 2003 when I decided to buy a new house in Pune during my vacation which was to be over in a week.

I first approached Canara Bank's Branch where I had my NRE Account since 1983 with some good amount of Fixed Deposits, the Bank Manager told me that it will take 3 weeks to one month for approving my housing loan application (only 40% of the total cost) by its Head Office in Bangalore.  I became very upset since I would not be able to book the house before completion of my vacation.  Luckily I met my friend in the Bank who had come for his Company's work and he advised me to go to SBT's Pune Branch in Deccan Gymkhana.  In fact, being out of India for a long time.

I was not aware that there exists a Branch of SBT in Pune.  Straight away I and my wife proceeded to the Branch. On meeting the officer processing the housing loan and explaining the purpose of our visit to the Branch, he immediately took us to the Chief Manager.  The chief manager gave a patient hearing to our requirement and immediately called the concerned officers/staff to his chamber and passed necessary instructions to process our housing loan application  urgently by obtaining all required documents from us and the builders. He also obtained our authorization letters to transfer our fixed deposits held with Canara Bank and SBT Pattambi to SBT's Pune Branch upon their respective maturity dates.  We were surprised to see the concerned staff's' initiative in obtaining the required documents including the clearance from their legal adviser for processing our housing loan application on a record speed.  Believe it or not, the loan was approved just in 4 days and a letter to that effect was given to us for submitting to the builders for registration of the property  in our names. Thus we completed all the formalities before we returned to resume duty as per our original schedule.  Hats off to SBT's Pune Branch as without their support we couldn't have had our dream home come true!!!",5,2
"Jul 18, 11 1:51",18/07/11,"While SBH website claims to provide support to setup Dairy projects, I experience reality when I visited my local branch for a loan of 5 lakh rupees to setup a mini Diary unit. When I spoke to the Field officer & Manager, I had 1Lakh rupees in my account, 50k in my mothers account . My fathers Savings account has been with SBH for last few years. I was ready to give about 30 acres of land as security.

My requst for loan was not accepted and the manager asked me to deposit 2.5 lakhs as FD for 5 years. What kinda rule is this? Such arm twisting tactics should not be entertained and strict action should be taken against this manager. How can he link giving a loan to ask for Fixed deposits.

While governments make tall claims about giving support to farmers, these schemes are only on paper and do not reach the intended.

Very very disappointed with SBH and am going to close all my family accounts immediately.

"Sep 8, 12 9:10",08/09/12,"As per my experience SBT has lost its pioneer in public sector due to their poor customer service and increased loan rates.Compared to other public sector banks, now this bank is charging loan rates very high.I had obtained a home loan from SBT at their spl home loan rate of 8 %.After 3 years they increased rate to 14.5%. I happened to know this only because I have Internet banking .The bank will not inform the customers .So what will happen to other people who don' t have Internet banking.Also that 14.5% they charged was mistake.Only after contacting their nodal home section they reduced the rate to 12.75%.

Once I lost my ATM card, I went and I informed about the incident. Immediately they blocked the card and applied for a new card. They have given me internet banking, mobile banking. The staffs are very cordial, especially the cashier of the branch he always greets with a smile in his face and provides all the information I seek from him. Even the accountant helps me to do the banking with ease.

As soon I took the loan, within few months the rate of 9.5% went to 11% and now as I entered the second year it got increased to 12%.

She did not give her name and when i actually got her name from her name plate hidden on her table, she said you want to complain, go ahead and i will see how you open an account in this branch.

"Apr 24, 15 6:31",24/04/15,"State Bank of Hyderabad has - Retail Assests Central Processing Centre.

Although the technology has been adopted to be competitive with other private banking companies. I think the competency and skills are not updated or very lithergic. The branch is provided with Customer care number with EPBAX facility. Whenever you call on that number, within 2 rings, the call gets connected and gets connected. Then you end the call, in the fear of getting higher mobile bill or calling charges. The thought that came to my mind was to need to redefine RAPC

R - Response should we provide?

A - Accountable to whom?

P - Politeness, something hearing for the first time?

C - Customer - we never care! Even after 10 tries, you will never gets connected to the person or any one pick up the call and answer your quires. Still we need this? The interest rates at SBH is high, still being an public sector, having faith people try to bank with no response!

I want to share my opinion about this Bank. I am a new customer of this bank, went to open the bank account. The behaviour of the staff is very rude, there customer services are very poor. The no. of ATM'S are sufficient but 50 to 70 percent of this ATM'S are out of service. This bank is very irresponsible bank , which never takes the responsibility of its work. There mobile and internet banking is only and only one good thing. Otherwise this bank is useless.

I recommend to all to not to be a part or customer of this bank.

I visited to exchange my torned notes and I have also searched that this is the branch which is approved by the reserve bank of India for exchanging old and torned notes .

It is a currency chest.

But when I asked for help no body responded positvely and said there is no such facility here and also the officer was not talking in proper way in which he should.

Cheap and abusive tone he used.

I have to go multiple times to get the details of my account transaction printed in my passbook.

I can not trust their service. Sometimes they send message for even a 1 ruppee transaction and sometime they won't send notification for a bigger amount. I am really frustated by this bank. Staff is only procrastinating their work or telling me that she/he will so it not him.

So we went back and next day we came in the morning.he was doing some work and I politly asked him that sir could you plz check the file if they reached you or not he now looked at me and said nhi ayi hai kl pta krna.I was so bemused that he did not check again said no.then my mom said lets go to the office and confirmed from them whether the sent the file to bank or not then we immedaitly went to the office and met the clerk who sent the files he checked his register and said that yes I already sent it to the next day the file must be in bank.

I was very angry at that time the officier absurdity was saying no to us.we immedaitly rushed to the bank and I was angry so I said wahan se file aa gyi hai aap check kro.he looked at me may be he knew that I was in angry mood so he said haan abhi kch files ayi hai dekhta ho naam batao haan aa gyi.we signed the documents and went back.So its very bad experience Now sbop merged with sbi but who cares staff would remain same and only bank board changes not the hearts of people like them who just enjoys while harassing the coustmors",1,-2

"Apr 20, 17 5:01",20/04/17,"Hi Friends, I would like to share my opinions about this bank.Its been more then 20 years I have an account with this bank. My account was opened when I was just 8, entire my family holds an account with SBM Bank in Vadagoan Belgaum Branch. The worst part is staff members working there are so lazy, they just want customers to wait until they finish all their stupid talks. Staff members are too old and they hardly work. I would request Govt to take a better action as the staff members are not at all help full. Specially when it comes to helping the old person coming to collect his / her pension, If the old women or man is not able to fill the withdrawal slip and when ask staff members to help, these staff members make faces and directly deny to help.I have seen these kind of issues more then 10 times.

Next is the online banking service is not at all user friendly, U cannot withdraw more then 20k by cheque in a different branch, they will ask you to go the home branch where you have opened the account. My mother also faced lot of problems with this bank, my entire family is not at all happy with the services. I will be closing all the account probably when I visit my native in next month.

I request people who are reading my feedback not to open an account in SBM, as these people are useless and there is no humanity in them.

All the staff members of SBM in Vadagaon Belgaum branch should be fired as they don't deserve being there. They don't know how to treat customers, very dominating people I have ever seen.",1,-2

"Dec 3, 17 7:45",03/12/17,"State Bank of Travancore is a Bank which is also known as SBT and is now Incorporated into State Bank of India ( SBI) . I had some banking experience with SBT. The functions of SBT is all like SBT. The Bank will take unnecessary charges and The Bank will not inform us before making charges from our account. We will get an idea only after checking our balance and the reason for loss of money will not be informed clearly. The interest policies of the Bank for all kinds of accounts are good. They are providing facilities like Debit and Credit cards, mobile banking, internet banking etc. Bank introduced mobile applications for mobile banking. Bank's credit and debit cards can be used in ATMs, for online shopping, for online payments etc. Through core banking system we can use the cards in any ATMs any where in India. So there is no problems of lack of ATMs. Customer care and support provided by the bank through it's branch , through phone, and through emails are very bad in my experience. They have no time to hear our problems and they will not provide any information or solution to our problems. At last I stopped using SBI. Overall I had a very bad experience.",1,-2

It is in sector 19 . Earlier they have more staff . It was helpful . Phone banking is not available . Due to less staff , you have to waste your 2 days for simple fd renewal policy . Their half staff is supportive , half not . They helped people during note ban by giving people right information & give extra money than their 2000 rs. Limit .

Overall it is ok bank .",3,0
