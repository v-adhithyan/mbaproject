Had there been any major movement from south to north or vice versa then only people who are in need would have got some relief. For all these anomaly none other than the management has to be blamed who wants to pasa the buck by the outcry of deficit circle gap.  We all are aware of deficit circles	 but when P.O. and T.o are recruited or promoted why are they not been posted on deficit circles for a minimum term.  Also post rationionalisation of branches where the surplus staff has been absorbed for that also no clarity.  Unable to manage HR issues professionally is the biggest draw back of our beloved organisation.

In order to encourage clerical staff to opt for promotion to Officer's cadre	 it is proposed to post them on promotion within the AO but other than the Region from? where promoted and will be retained for one term.

The Centre merged five banks	 State Bank of Hyderabad	 State Bank of Travancore	 State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur	 State Bank of Mysore and State Bank of Patiala with SBI through a notification on February . But employees and officers of subsidiary banks are nurturing apprehensions about working conditions in the new dispensation which is now seeking options from them.  Justice P Naveen Rao	 who heard a lunch motion moved by P T M Gopalakrishna and eight other officers of SBH and Associate Banks Officers Association	 directed SBI chairman	 Union finance ministry and RBI not to act on options given by subsidiary officers till June . Officers have given their options as the SBI management gave them little time and the deadline to comply with the options norm too expired on April 	 the petitioners said. They expressed apprehension they may not be treated on par with SBI employees despite they ending up as employees of same entity.  Arguing the case of petitioners	 senior counsel R Vaigai who flew to Hyderabad from Chennai	 told court the SBI management has not yet spelt out clearly on new working conditions for subsidiary officers. It sought options in very short time and all of them submitted options without knowing about their future	 she said. There was no clarity on seniority	 pension and terminal benefits	 she said. It is unlawful to set a deadline for exercising options without clarifying what they actually would mean	 she said.  None of the subsidiary officers was heard before deciding their future	 she said. Employees were forced to give options and all of them had given their options on Thursday	 the last date	 she said. The judge too said there was a need to extend cut-off date and sought a counter from authorities on plans. SBI counsel M Narender Reddy assured the court that SBI would act in a fair manner. Even SBI would not be able to finalise options given by subsidiary officers	 he said. The case will come up for hearing again in the first week of June.  HYDERABAD: Employees of erstwhile State Bank of Hyderabad (SBH) and other four associate banks merged with State Bank of India (SBI) on April 	 heaved a sigh of relief on Thursday	 following the breather given to them by Hyderabad High Court till June . Clarifying that the relief would be applicable to employees of all five associate banks	 Harshvardhan Madabhushi	 general secretary	 Associate Bank Officers Association (ABOA)	 which filed the petition in the HC	 said: """"You need to tell employees being absorbed (in SBI) what is in store for them. When there is no clarity on the issue	 how can employees decide whether they want to join or not. The court has seen contradictions and given relief.""""  He said they had no option	 but to knock on doors of the court as attempts to raise concerns with SBI management	 finance minister Arun Jaitley and RBI governor came to naught. Saying that associate bank employees had been feeling cheated	 he accused SBI of trying to create two sets of officers within the same bank with different service conditions. """"If nearly 	 officers	 which is almost half the total number of officers in SBI	 are given such a raw deal what kind of devastating effects the accumulated frustration of so many people will have on the organization? This is something no one seems to have thought of	 he said.  """"A merger is not just about buildings and tables and chairs. You have to take people along with you. After all	 these banks existed for - long glorious years and have been doing exceedingly well. Now	 the government is trying to portray our advantage of creating a niche in operations as a geographical concentration risk	 he said.

974,"  ::."";""Facebook:<page>/posts"";"""";""SBI may introduce variable pay structure; Unions say it might be difficult for them to stop this move after merger.  State Bank of India (SBI) might revive an old salary structure proposal that the bank always wanted to implement but could not because of union pressure. The structure entails that the salaries of officers in scale four to seven be divided into fixed and variable components. Fixed will club basic	 dearness allowance	 house rent allowance and the rest would be performance linked variable.     The new structure	 if adopted	 would be applicable for the employees of associate banks	 too	 once they become part of SBI after April . According to a senior SBI official	 performing employees want a variable pay structure as their hard work would not be rewarded otherwise. The new wage structure need not mean pay would be less than the current package	 but there would be scope for an upside through this structure	 the official said.     SBI has been trying to introduce this for some time and in wage negotiations	 the bank has time and again rooted for it. But unions have scuttled the proposal. This time	 however	 the case could be different. The unions said a variable structure seemed inevitable now.     It doesnt look like we would be able to stop this structure after merger. The bank management will force officers to sign the deal and will carve out a different structure than the industry	 said a senior union leader.     Associate banks have already offered employees a voluntary retirement scheme (VRS). The scheme is expected to be widely accepted. The scheme is for employees who have completed  years of service or have five years of service left. Unions have asked employees to reject the offer. But it would be difficult to convince the employees	 conceded unions.     This is because a number of branches would have to be closed or re-designated after the merger and existing staff could get transfers arbitrarily	 said bank unions.     As of March 	 SBI had an employee strength of 	. State Bank of Travancore had 	 employees	 State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur had 		 State Bank of Mysore had 		 State Bank of Hyderabad had 	 and State Bank of Patiala had 	. The last two are not listed. How the associate bank employees would be treated largely depends on the success of the VRS scheme. If it is a failure	 the employees could get rough treatment	 said a senior official of an associate bank.     If the previous merger is any indication	 associate bank employees could expect some discrimination as a given. Predictably	 unions are opposing the move and the agitation might intensify soon. After the merger with State Bank of Saurashtra and State Bank of Indore	 the SBI management reduced seniority of the officers from the merged entities.     Seniority of scale one officers of State Bank of Saurashtra was reduced by a year	 scale two officers by two years and scale three officers by three years. A case in this regard is going on. Perhaps to counter the loss of seniority problem	 associate banks managements have given aggressive promotions to employees since talks of the merger started firming up	 said sources. This has not gone down well with SBI employees.     SBI is currently offering a smart package for its officers in scales one to three. The package entails monetising all small perks. For scale one officers	 the monetisation comes at Rs . lakh a year. For scale two	 it is Rs.. lakh and for scale three it around Rs.. lakh. Unions had advised the employees to reject the offer.""																																																																																																																							"

They do not practice relationship banking	 as they do not listen to the customers and solve their problems. I feel they should be sent  for training on HOW TO BEHAVE WITH HUMAN BEINGS? They get salary bcoz of our deposits. Madam Bhattacharya must take necessary steps to retrain most of the employees. They even hesitate to update the pass book which requires no knowledge and skill. My view is that BCOM AND BBA graduates can be hired to update the pass books as many a time machines are not listening....At least SBM employees are cordial and believe in establishing relationship with their customers. I find small banks better as they take extra care ....""

1571," Cabinet-February	  : IST Cabinet approves acquisition of subsidiary banks of State Bank of India  The Union Cabinet	 chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modihas approved the acquisition by the State Bank of India of its subsidiary banks namely State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur	 State Bank of Hyderabad	 State Bank of Mysore	 State Bank of Patiala and State Bank of Travancore.   The Cabinet also approved the introduction of a Bill in Parliament to repeal the State Bank of India (Subsidiary Banks) Act	  and the State Bank of Hyderabad Act	 .  The merger is likely to result in recurring savings	 estimated at more than Rs. 	 crore in the first year	 through a combination of enhanced operational efficiency and reduced cost of funds.  Existing customers of subsidiary banks will benefit from access to SBIs global network.  The merger will also lead to better management of high value credit exposures through focused monitoring and control over cash flows instead of separate monitoring by six different banks.  The acquisition under Section  of the State Bank of India Act	  will result in the creation of a stronger merged entity.  This will minimize vulnerability to any geographic concentration risks faced by subsidiary banks.  It will create improved operational efficiency and economies of scale.  It will also result in improved risk management and unified treasury operations.               The acquisition of subsidiary banks of State Bank is an important step towards strengthening the banking sector through consolidation of public sector banks.  It is in pursuance of the Indradhanush action plan of the Government and it is expected to strengthen the banking sector and improve its efficiency and profitability.  ****   AKT/VBA/SH  (Release ID :)""																																																																																																																																															"

1809," BI pushes merger of five associate banks	 BMB to next fiscal The merger would make SBI a global-sized bank and would be amongst the top  lenders in the world	 with an asset base of Rs  trillion or over USD  billion. BY: PTI | MUMBAI | Published On: January 	  : Pm State Bank of India	 Demonetisation	 Master card	 Visa card	 debit card	 news	 latest news	 India news	 national news	 SBI	 RuPay debit cards	 merchant discount rate	  Arundhati Bhattacharya Arundhati Bhattacharya	 Chairman	 SBI. (File Photo) State Bank chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya on Monday hinted that the mega merger of its five associate banks and Bharatiya Mahila Bank (BMB) could be pushed to the next financial year as it is still awaiting the government notification on the move. Probably	 by a quarter or so (the merger could be delayed). The reason is we still have to get the government approval and even if we get it now	 doing things like merger in the last quarter is never a very wise thing because there would be lot of IT system changes	 she told reporters when asked whether the merger could be delayed due to the disruptions caused by the demonetisation drive. Watch What Else Is Making News  The merger would make SBI a global-sized bank and would be amongst the top  lenders in the world	 with an asset base of Rs  trillion or over USD  billion	 with 	 branches and over 	 ATMs and more than  crore customers. Bhattacharya said normally the banks close down all the IT system changes by mid-February. Sometimes IT system can impact something else quite unknowingly. So we dont want to take any risks at the annual closing time. So we may want to do the annual closing and then look at it	 she added. When asked whether she has a new time in mind for the merger process to be completed	 the chairperson said no yet. Let me first get the government approval only then we will know. When specifically asked what sort of government approval is pending	 the chairperson said the government has to notify the merger scheme. It can be noted that the bank had announced the merger in May and its central board of directors had in August approved the process along with the share swap ratio for three of the listed associate banks and Bharatiya Mahila Bank. At that time it was announced that the merger would be completed by end March . The (merger) process will start by October-end. The grievance committee will come to us hopefully by September end	 after that we have to send it to RBI and then to the government	 which may probably take a little time of about month; and then it will come to us. After that we will have to make an offer to employees and then give them four weeks time and then the merger can take place	 Bhattacharya had told PTI in an interview in September. SBI has three listed associate banks  State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur (SBBJ)	 State Bank of Mysore (SBM)	 State Bank of Travancore (SBT) and two unlisted associate bank -State Bank of Patiala and State Bank of Hyderabad. As per the swap ratio	 SBBJ shareholders would get  shares of SBI (Rs  each) for every  shares (Rs  each). Similarly	 SBM and SBT shareholders would get  shares of SBI for every  shares. In case of Bharatiya Mahila Bank				 shares of SBI would be swapped for every  crore of Rs  each. The lender had put in place a grievance redressal mechanism to provide an opportunity to its shareholders to file their objections with regard to the share swap ratios. It had given  calendar days of time for shareholders to register their complaints. The grievance committee was headed by a High Court judge and two chartered accountants. Bhattacharya said post the merger of five associate banks and Bharatiya Mahila Bank	 the governments stake in the bank would stand at around  per cent. SBI has around 	 branches	 including  foreign offices spread across  countries. Globally	 SBI will come at the th position in terms of asset size after the merger. SBI first merged State Bank of Saurashtra with itself in . Two years later	 State Bank of Indore was merged""																																																																																																															"

Few months are left for merger	 I can understand the sentiments of all SBBJIANS and our Top management members from other associates who have body and soul accepted SBBJ equally as their mother	 like their parent Banks. Changes are inevitable. They've to be accepted and we need to move with time. I am facing so many changes this month 	 I have accepted all with equaminity 	 I earnestly implore all to continue their excellent performance at the grass root level 	 guidance at controlling levels and dedicated mentoring at Top Management level. Some customers were mentioning regarding slowdown in decision making process avoidance by certain branch heads in taking loan proposals due to uncertainties of merger. I earnestly request that let's all from today rededicate ourself to our prime task and perform with unmatched excellence for which we are known.

The proposal (to merge all SBI associates with SBI) is pending with the Government. The Government will respond shortly. Government policy by and large supports consolidation. I had indicated it in the Budget itself	 Jaitley told reporters after his quarterly performance review meeting with chief executives of public sector banks here.  Asked if the Centre had any other consolidation candidates before it	 Jaitley replied in the negative. We are looking at SBI for the moment	 Jaitley said. .  The countrys largest lender	 State Bank of India	 had on May  said it was seeking the Centres nod to merge its five associate banks and the newly created Bharatiya Mahila Bank with itself.  This follows the boards of the associate banks  State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur	 State Bank of Hyderabad	 State Bank of Mysore	 State Bank of Patiala and State Bank of Travancore  approving resolutions on May  to pave the way for their acquisition by SBI.  Credit metrics  Global credit rating agency Moodys Investors Services had later said that the proposed merger of six banks  five associate banks and Bharatiya Mahila Bank (BMB)  with State Bank of India (SBI) will have limited impact on the latters credit metrics.  SBI already fully owns State Bank of Hyderabad (SBH) and State Bank of Patiala (SBP) and has majority stakes in the other three  State Bank of Mysore (SBM)	 State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur (SBBJ) and State Bank of Travancore (SBT)  associate banks.  BMB only started operations in  and accounts for less than . per cent of SBI's total assets.  Moodys said that based on current stock market prices	 the acquisition of the remaining outstanding shares in SBBJ	 SBM and SBT will cost SBI about Rs. 	 crore (approximately $ million).  Assuming SBI completes the transaction using its own cash	 its common equity tier- ratio would decrease by only about  basis points	 it added.  In addition	 on a consolidated basis	 the merger will have limited impact on the financial metrics of SBI	 including its asset quality and capitalisation level. From an operations perspective	 the merger offers SBI the potential to leverage synergies	 Moodys had said.""

Sources said that the bank is going through a crucial phase and is gearing up to take over its subsidiaries and the Bharatiya Mahila Bank. Bhattacharya	 who has been driving the bank for the last three years	 may be given an extension for a few months to ensure a smooth transition.   A final decision would be taken only after two months based on a thorough assessment of the situation.

Extension (of Bhattacharya) will be considered..there is no decision on the issue as yet and only preliminary talks have on the issue (of the post) have been held	 the source said. Bhattacharya was the first woman chief of the bank.  She has been dynamic in her performance and has managed things very well especially at a time when the industry is going through a tough phase with non performing assets surging to alarming levels	 he added. Bhattacharya is also known for being vocal against willful defaulters including Vijay Mallya	 promoter of the now defunct Kingfisher Airlines.   Sources added that Bhattacharya will bag a respectable and responsible position after her innings with SBI.   Last year	 the government for the first time	 threw its doors open to private sector executives to head large state owned lenders and Canara Bank and Bank of Baroda got their chiefs from the private sector.

According to official sources	  chief general managers of SBI appeared for the interview for the post of deputy managing directors which was held here on Wednesday. Apart from the  CGMs of the parent bank	 three CGMs who are currently heading the associate banks of the SBI Group were also interviewed. There are around seven positions of DMDs to be filled up at the bank during the current financial year.  Some of the top posts of SBI will be up for grabs this year. SBI chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya	 who got a three-year term	 is due for her retirement in September	 whereas VG Kannan	 managing director of the bank	 will be retiring next month. The other three MDs are B Sriram	 Rajnish Kumar and PK Gupta. The government is yet to make any decision on appointing a successor to Bhattacharya.

4355," Namaskar Dosto	  Com. Harshavardhan Madabhushi our General Secretary	 ABOA addressed the SBH Head Office officers  on the issue of Acquisition of Associate Banks with State Bank o India.  He returned after attending the Board Meeting @Mumbai  yesterday where the Board of AB's has given consent to the acquisition of AB's by SBI.   He told that  Emergency/Special Board meetings of all the ABs were held on th May  at Corporate Office	 Mumbai wherein a Table Item was introduced in the all the Boards	 to seek in-principle approval to enter into negotiation with SBI for acquisition of the business including assets and liabilities of Associate Banks. This was followed by an EC meeting of SBI Board of Directors on the same day	 which recommended the resolutions of Boards of ABs to its Board. The SBI Board of Directors today (--) has approved the same and recommended to the Government for its approval.He said that the Chairman of SBI	 chairing  Board meetings in a row on a single day itself	 is a record of sorts and signifies urgency attached to the resolutions.  The observations in this regard made by Shri Harshavardhan Madabhushi which have been recorded in the minutes of the meeting are as follows:  - Acquisition of Associate Banks shall be on an At Par basis	 without discrimination whatsoever if it is with SBI;  -Officers Association	 ABOA	 representing all Supervisory Staff to be taken into confidence	 prior to acquisition	 on all matters concerning them	 viz. HR Issuesincluding protection of seniority	 one-time inter-circle transfer option	 Special Compensatory Allowance	 Additional Increments	 Transfer Policy	 Promotion Policy	 etc.;  -All benefits as available to Officers in State Bank of India to be passed on to the Officers in Associate Banks right from a common date	 viz. the date on which acquisition is contemplated / cleared or the first appointed date of acquisition of any of the Associate Banks;  -All Head Offices of individual Associate Banks are to be converted into separate Local Head Offices of State Bank of India;  -Some of the Superannuation Benefits in Associate Banks	 being a shade better	 shall be passed on uniformly to State Bank of India; and  -Disciplinary Matters persisting at the time of acquisition to be dealt with as per the provisions obtaining in the relevant Associate Banks.  Com Harshavardhan discussed all the above issues at length in the meeting and expressed all the apprehensions of the officers of SBH on transfers	 promotions	 parity with SBI officers and various other HR issues  and expressed his happiness as the Chairman responded to very positively to all the points raised by him.  Com Harshavardhan said that while responding to the above observations	 the Chairman	 Smt. Arundhathi Bhattacharya has said that the Table Agenda is only a proposal and finally requires the approval of the Government. The Chairman has	 in no uncertain terms	 promised that the ABOA leadership will be taken into confidence and will be invited for discussions on all HR matters	 on receipt of approval from the Government. The Chairman has further said that she would try to ensure that there will not be any sort of discrimination to Officers in ABs and will strive to ensure on par treatment with their counterparts in SBI.  Com. Harshavardhan was happy as the issue of merger met with a logical end and as promised in the General Body Meeting	  he played his role successfully well in discussing with the Chairman on the issues concerning the welfare and well being of officers of AB's in the merged entity of AB's and SBI  and in getting an assurance from Chairman to that extant.  Further	 he added that the Executive Committee of ABOA is meeting on th and th June  wherein all our expectations/demands in the interest of all our members to post-acquisition will be discussed threadbare on the experiences based on past  mergers viz. SBS and SB Indore	 and the same will be followed up very vigorously with SBI management and All India State Bank Officers Federation to which we are the strongest affiliate.

AIEBA general secretary C.H.Venkatachalam also said the union has called for a strike on June  and July  this year to press for the merger demand.  He also hoped that the boards of the five associate banks - State Bank of Travancore (SBT)	 State Bank of Mysore (SBM)	 State Bank of Hyderabad (SBH)	 State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur (SBBJ) and State Bank of Patiala (SBP) - and also that of SBI would consider that proposal.  """"Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley also opined that the five associate banks of SBI could be merged into one thereby creating a strong entity	 Venkatachalam told IANS.  He hoped the boards of the six banks in their next meeting would consider the merger proposal.  """"Though on principle we are against consolidation in the banking industry	 in the case of five associate banks	 we prefer the same instead of each one merging into SBI	 Venkatachalam said.""

4909,"  ::."";""Facebook:<page>/posts"";"""";""I did not understood.... did you ? please comment  Christine Lagarde	 managing director of International Monetary Fund (IMF)	 appeared largely convinced about the good state of Indian economy when she delivered a speech at the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Tuesday. Lagarde showered praises to almost everyone among Indian policymakers - from RBI governor Raghuram Rajan to prime minister Narendra Modi. Lagarde spoke of India shining brightly among the emerging markets	 complimented Rajan for steering the Indian economy to safer waters and praised Modi for his ambitious financial inclusion programme	 Jan Dhan Yojana	 under which crores of bank accounts were opened in a short span of time. But then came the caution. Lagarde said fast-paced financial development in an economy could offer more harm than positives. According to the IMF chief	 deepening of financial institutions	 when done too fast can lead to economic and financial instability. The experience of advanced economies has shown the dangers that can arise from oversized financial systems	 Lagarde said. Fast-paced development of institutions	 Lagarde said	 encourages greater risk-taking and high leverage	 particularly when poorly regulated and supervised. This caution is particularly relevant for India	 where concerns of financial systems growing much faster in relation to the size than the overall economy. Oversized financial institutions Like oversized financial systems	 problems arising out of oversized financial institutions too have been highlighted by the Indian policymakers in the past. This was in the context of widening gap in asset sizes of the largest bank (State Bank of India) and the rest of its competitors. In August		 former RBI governor	 D Subbarao	 had raised this issue. Presently	 (there is) significant skewness in the size of banks. The second largest bank in the system is almost one-third the size of the biggest bank. This creates a monopolistic situation	 Subbarao had said. The reason why policymakers were worried about the 'oversized' financial institutions is that if something goes wrong with them	 this can have serious ramifications on the whole financial system. Developed economies of the world have had their share of woes from too-big-to-fail financial institutions. Probably	 this is something that might have prompted the US federal reserve to finalise a rule in November last year that prohibits any financial company from acquiring another	 if the resultant entity's liabilities exceeded  percent of the total liabilities of the financial services system. The new rule - Section  of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act - says once a particular entity reaches the specified concentration limit	 that bank cannot acquire control of another entity. Logically	 the new rule intends to shield the US financial system from the foibles of 'too big to fail' banks	 which could then spark a crisis like the one in  following the collapse of Lehman Brothers	 which triggered a global financial meltdown. That meltdown showed that when banks become too big	 they can bring down the whole financial system when they lend or invest imprudently. In India too	 the RBI is doing the ground work to identify and regulate systemically important financial institutions. In July	 it released a framework to identify domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs) and said four to six banks could come under this category. The idea is to bring such entities under """"differentiated supervisory requirements and higher intensity of supervision"""". Banks having a size beyond  percent of gross domestic product (about Rs 		 crore) will be considered to be part of this category. If one applies this size formula	 at least  banks will fall under the D-SIB bucket. These include State Bank of India (SBI)	 Bank of Baroda	 ICICI Bank	 Bank of India	 Punjab National Bank	 Canara Bank	 HDFC Bank	 Axis Bank	 Union Bank	 IDBI Bank	 Central Bank	 Indian Overseas Bank and Syndicate Bank. To be sure	 size alone wouldn't make these entities D-SIBs. The RBI would also consider their interconnectedness	 substitutability and complexity for that. On the other hand	 if one goes by the Fed formula	 i.e.	 deposits or liabilities equal to  percent of the system	 SBI would be the only bank to come under this definition. It would be restricted from adding further liabilities and monitored more closely. Most other bigger banks will come much below this trigger on a standalone basis	 even though any possible merger involving large banks such as Bank Baroda	 Bank of India	 Punjab National Bank and Canara would result in entities that will have liabilities over the Fed's threshold. SBI	 which has assets of Rs . lakh crore as of  December 	 is nowhere among the top lenders in the world. But for India's Rs 		 crore banking sector	 SBI is T-Rex. Going by asset size	 SBI is nearly thrice as large as the next bank BoB	 which has asset size of about Rs . lakh crore as of  December . Also	 SBI had a deposit base of Rs . lakh crore	 which is about . percent of the total deposits of the whole industry. That's not all. SBI is on course to even grow its liability size by merging its associates with itself. Of the seven associate banks	 two - State Bank of Saurashtra and State Bank of Indore - were merged with SBI in  and 	 respectively. According to the government's stated roadmap	 the larger plan is to merge the remaining five subsidiaries with the parent entity. These are State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur	 State Bank of Hyderabad	 State Bank of Mysore and State Bank of Patiala. If one takes the whole SBI group's liabilities even at this stage	 the share of deposits to the total industry stands at a huge  percent as of June. To be sure	 there is no rationale in comparing the US banking system with the Indian banking industry. The total assets of US banks are more than  times that of Indian banks. Clearly	 Indian banks are midgets in comparison to US counterparts. But Lagardes caution on oversized financial systems in relation to the economies they exist very much applies to the Indian context  both in the context of fast growing banking system and the widening gap among its large financial institutions. Clearly	 Rajan can take a lesson or two from IMF chiefs warnings to avert a repetition of west-like financial crisis.

4920,"  ::."";""Facebook:<page>/posts"";"""";""PSU banks asked to explore mergers  The government wants to encourage state-run banks to start looking for opportunities for consolidation and suggest ways of merger with other banks as it progressively cuts down capital support to them.  Merger and consolidation of banks is being looked at as part of a plan to give a lifeline to smaller and weaker banks as the government has changed the criteria of providing equity capital to the banks it owns and has decided to reward only the better-performing ones.  Earlier the governments would provide assistance to all banks that needed it by subscribing to fresh equity that in turn enabled them to raise more funds from the market and expand their lending capacity. This also helped the government to hold on to its stake in these banks as their equity base expanded.  This financial year banks that had better than average return on assets and return on equity for the past three years were considered for fresh capital and only nine of the  state-run banks made the mark.  As against Rs 	 crore that was provided for in the budget for -	 the government gave only Rs 	 crore to nine state-run banks.  For the next financial year only Rs 	 crore has been set aside for the purpose and performance criteria will be the same to decide who gets how much.  While it is much lower than what had been given in previous years	 officials said this should not worry banks much as they have been allowed to raise money from the markets through a follow-on public offer or qualified institutional placement by diluting the governments holding to  per cent in stages.  According to estimates	 the Indian banking system needs close to Rs . lakh crore by  to meet the reserve requirements mandated by the Basel committee on banking supervision. The new Basel III rules come into force from March .  In July last year the government had mandated SBI Capital Markets to prepare two reports on mergers and consolidations in public sector banks as well as their recapitalisation. The reports have been presented to the government but its contents are still to be made public.  The governments have been talking of merger and consolidation of state-run banks for creating bigger banks that can compete with globally on size for long. The idea was advocated by then FM P Chidambaram but with the caveat that the proposal for mergers should come from the banks themselves.  Process may not take off due to opposition by the bank unions. Only SBI was able to merge with its two associate banks	 State Bank of Saurashtra and State Bank of Indore.

Banks Board Bureau to be set up in  months: Finmin  The government will soon set up an autonomous Banks Board Bureau (BBB)	 a super authority for PSU lenders to recommend board level appointments and advise on strategies for raising funds as well as mergers & acquisitions.  BBB is likely to be a six-member board comprising former CMDs of banks and financial services sector experts. It will be headed by Secretary	 Department of Financial Services.  There are  state-owned banks in India including SBI	 IDBI Bank and Bhartiya Mahila Bank.  """"The Bureau should be hopefully in place in the next - months after it is cleared by Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC) headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi	 Department of Financial Services Secretary Hasmukh Adhia told PTI in an interview.  Once in place	 BBB will search and select heads of public sector banks and help them develop differentiated strategies of capital raising plans to innovative financial methods and instruments	 he said.  It would also be responsible for selection of non-executive chairman and non-official directors on the boards	 he said.  Besides	 BBB will also steer strategy discussion on consolidation based on the requirement	 Adhia added.  Government wants to encourage Bank Boards to restructure their business strategy and also suggest way forward for their consolidation and merger with other banks if it is win-win for both	 the Finance Ministry said in a statement recently.  Last week	 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in his Budget speech had announced setting up the autonomous Banks Board Bureau for helping lenders raise capital for meeting expansion needs.  Proposed BBB is part of overall strategy for restructuring of public sector banks and a step towards establishing a holding and investment company for lenders.  This issue was discussed extensively at the Gyan Sangam addressed by Modi in the first week of January.  During the two-day bankers' retreat	 heads of financial institutions have suggested the creation of Bank Investment Committee (BIC) and transfer of the government's investment in banks to BIC.  Creation of BIC would over the time enable the government to reduce ownership to below  per cent and help banks generate capital for growth.  In December	 the government decided to permit public sector banks to raise up to Rs 	 crore from capital markets by diluting government holding to  per cent in phases so as to meet Basel III capital adequacy norms.  Public sector banks alone require Rs . lakh crore by  to meet global Basel III norms.""

The court clarified that TDS should not be imposed on LFC payments made pending final disposal of writ petition. An advice to this effect has been sent to respondent banks	 according to R Vaigai	 Anna Mathew and K Tamilarasan	 counsels for petitioners. Justice S Nagamuthu had ordered an interim stay on the contentious circular in May last year on a writ moved by the All India State Bank Officers Federation	 (AISBOF) Chennai	 and All India Bank Officers Confederation (AIBOC)	 New Delhi. The petitioners had sought an interim stay on the circular of April  by the Chief Executive	 Indian Banks Association (IBA) read with the e-circular dated April  by Deputy Managing Director and Corporate Development Officer	 State Bank of India. Counsel for petitioners had cited specific provisions of leave travel/home travel concession rules to substantiate their argument against the circular.

The extension of the stay comes in response to a rejoinder affidavit filed by D Thomas Franco Rajendra Dev	 Vice-President	 AISBOF	 and joint general secretary	 AIBOC. Officers are permitted to touch foreign land within the permitted limit of LFC provided the foreign travel is covered in between the domestic destinations	 Dev submitted.

There is no such proposal on cards now	 said SBH Managing Director (MD) Santanu Mukherjee.  He was in the city to inaugurate an e-Connect lobby and commercial branch on Tuesday. The merger was not possible given the bank's performance and capital issues.  All the banks were performing well and were not stressed out. The merger may not be ideal proposal for present day situation. The merger would bring down the capital	 he felt.  It may be recalled that the merger of SBH	 which tops the five associate banks in performance	 with its parent has been under active consideration for long. The SBI owns entire share capital of the SBH.  Mr. Mukherjee said that the SBH had stepped up efforts to rein in Non-Performing Assets (NPAs). All the branches were asked to go to villages and lay emphasis on recovery of NPAs. More so	 the State Government had set the ball rolling by kick-starting debt redemption. It would take more than a month for release of funds etc. It would help in roll over of agricultural loans and eliminating the NPAs	 he added.  The banker	 however	 said that it was not possible to arrive at a figure on what portion of agricultural loans turned into NPAs. I am quite optimistic about the outcome of our ongoing efforts to tame the NPAs by the end of current financial year	 he said.

In terms of a timeline when do you think it could happen?  A: Consolidation is something that will happen. When is really the question? Even the Prime Minister in his address to us he mentioned that the fact that there are four Chinese Banks in the top twenty in the world. Those Chinese banks have grown on the back of the Chinese economy. However	 as he sees the Indian economy going up he also expect that some of us will be in those top twenty.  If we are going to be in the top twenty you are looking at mergers they is no other way growing organically at that speed would be very difficult. So	 inorganic should be the way that we should proceed. Having said that why is it not happening at this point of time. If you look at some of the banks those that are weak and some of the banks those that are strong	 the strong are not really particularly enamored about taking over the weak banks. For that matter neither are the weak ones because they feel that they will be overwhelmed.  So actually speaking when there is a union or a marriage it should be between strong and strong not between strong and weak. Therefore the idea that was mooted was that give us the time to get out of this very stressed economic cycle	 let us put everything in order	 let us see how best we can find out niche strengths and see how best we can position ourselves. So	 that when this happens it is more of a union between likes than between a like and not one similar.  That was a view point behind whatever were the deliberations but it was clearly understood that you have to be able to make a difference; you have to differentiate your offering in whichever way you can and whatever you are offering you have to be a strong bank.

At the two-day Gyan Sangam of public sector banks (PSBs) held in Pune over the weekend	 chiefs of large banks	 probably for the first time	 conveyed to finance ministry officials that they are not in a position to take over smaller banks	 because they face the same problems as their potential targets. Thus	 any acquisition will only bring more stress to their balance sheet and lead to a situation of the blind leading the blind.   Industry officials said that even SBI has conceded merger of associate banks with itself is not possible immediately. According to them	 in a closed-door meeting between bankers and finance ministry officials in Pune	 Arundhati Bhattacharya	 chairman	 SBI	 said merger can happen only after the performance of an associate bank matches SBI's standard.  When contacted by ET	 Bhattacharya declined to comment on this issue. SBI's net non-performing assets	 at .% as of March 	 are lower than its associates. Also	 SBI's ability to absorb shock measured by way of capital adequacy ratio stood at .%	 higher than its associates.  Besides	 pension benefits of SBI employees are better than associate banks which means it will have to increase pension benefits of the associate bank from the day of merger.   SBI had provided Rs  crore towards pension benefits of State Bank of Indore and State Bank of Saurashtra that it acquired. It is estimated that	 if merged	 it will have to spend around Rs 	 crore for pension benefits of its remaining five associate banks.   At the Pune conference	 the finance ministry had formed six different groups comprising bankers	 bureaucrats and RBI officials to propose strategies for banking reforms.   The mergers and consolidation group suggested that the time is not ripe for mergers as they will not be able to derive the benefits of the consolidation. """"It was concluded that we should look for better times when the NPAs are under control and when banks have better capital adequacy ratio	 said a bank executive who was part of this group.   The finance ministry also accepted that any proposal of merger should be mooted by boards of banks and not driven by the government	 officials said. Under the UPA government	 former finance minister P Chidambaram had often urged PSBs to form - big banks through consolidation to match the size of Chinese banks.

The government will only sensitise the lenders about the possibility of a merger and if their boards decide to engage into any consolidation deals they can approach the government for necessary approvals	 Financial Services Secretary Hasmukh Adhia said. The banks were of the view that when it comes to consolidation	 the bank boards will themselves decide whether it is good for us to have any consolidation. This is the view of the bankers which the government respects	 we would not like to mandate them saying do this or do that	 Adhia told reporters here at the end of a two-day bankers retreat. He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised that the government will not to interfere with the running of a banks and wondered how the government can force down a consolidation when it has clearly spelt out its intent.  He said the government will only sensitise the lenders about the possibility of a merger and attempts like the retreat is one of the ways of driving the process. If two banks boards decide to come together	 they can get into a conversation around it and they can request the government to approve it	 Adhia said. Adhia said in his address that Modi has asked the bankers present	 most of whom were PSBs	 to create an entity which is among the ten large banks in the world.  At present	 the countrys largest lender	 State Bank of India is ranked in the s in terms of asset size. It is the only Indian bank among the worlds largest  lenders. State-run banks merger has been talked about for long	 especially given the need to create a lender of a global size. The government has earlier said said it would like to first merge SBI and its associate banks together first and then get to merging other banks. According to some analysts	 the government would like to merge a strong bank with a weaker one and also look at complementarity on the geographical presence front while taking such a call.  Other issues like the working ethos in a bank are also important and would have to be looked into. Bank unions are vociferously opposing plans of such mergers.

The interaction is expected to lay some initial roadmap on the reform path for these entities. The meeting comes in the backdrop of state-run banks facing severe stress arising out of bad loans among government banks as highlighted by the recent financial stability report of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)	 and the consequential capital implications. The NDA government is yet to clarify its policy stance on its willingness to give the much needed autonomy to state-run banks by way of privatising these entities. During the seven months since Modi came to power	 not even once	 he has spoken on any concrete plans on the privatisation of sarkari entities. These banks control over  percent of the banking industry by assets but carries over  percent of the total bad loans in the banking system on their balance sheets. Andhra bank Among the probable candidates for the merger could be Andhra Bank and United Bank of India	 reports say As Firstpost has noted before	 the government being in the business of banking serves no purpose and often leads to lack of autonomy in the functioning of state-run banks and their misuse to roll out the governments populist agenda. This situation can be changed only if these banks are relieved of the curse of micromanagement by politicians	 which was most visible during the -year UPA rule and something that the current NDA government tend to follow. One critical aspect Modi is likely to discuss with bankers is the consolidation path for state-run banks. According to reports	 the government might consider merging weaker state-run banks	 which have high level of bad loans	 with strong	 large banks in order to execute a rescue mission. Among the probable candidates for the merger could be Andhra Bank and United Bank of India	 which have been facing severe stress on their balance sheets on account of high level of stressed assets. The government should refrain from merging a weak government bank with a strong well-run bank as it can put even the acquirer bank in trouble. Merger of a weak public sector bank	 neck-deep in bad loans	 with a strong bank as a panacea to salvage the former	 can lead to an eventual disaster. That is because the reasons for stress on the balance sheets of the target bank	 like in the cases of Andhra Bank (high NPAs from agriculture loans) or United Bank (bad loans from mid-sized and large companies) are unlikely to get resolved through a merger with another government bank like Bank of Baroda or Punjab National Bank	 which already have their own share of troubles to handle. The better solution will be to sell off weak state-run banks to private banks	 which have deep-pockets and expertise to repair the stressed assets and get these entities back on track. This is something	 for which RBI governor	 Raghuram Rajan	 publicly made a strong case some five months back. Rajans points were these: For one	 merging two unhealthy banks in the financial system will create an unhealthy entity that would lead to creation of a bigger problem in the economy. Secondly	 even in the case of the merger of an unhealthy bank with a large healthy bank	 the merger would bring problems to the acquiring bank. Thirdly	 in the event of a merger of a weak bank with a strong bank	 the acquirer will have to deal with the cultural problems that arise out of the merger	 besides dealing with the primary challenge  the bad loan pile in the weak bank  creating difficulties for the strong bank. By any yardsticks	 it will be ideal for the government to pay attention to the former International Monetary Fund economist-turned-central banker and not hurry with the merger of United Bank or any other weaker state-run bank for a few reasons: For one	 the bad loan problem in a particular bank is created over years	 not overnight. Hence the solution cannot come overnight. Apart from the general economic slowdown common to all banks	 the reasons for sticky assets in a bank can vary from careless lending to weak risk management tools to interested-party lending at the behest of powerful industrialists or politicians. In other words	 there is a past attached to the stressed assets in the books of every bank and mostly reasons for the bad loan rise vary with banks. In the event of a merger	 dealing with this bad loan pile may not be easier for a currently healthy bank that is forced to acquire the weak bank. Besides causing a sudden rise in its bad loans and resultant provision levels	 the new chunk of bad assets can become a drag on the books of the host bank for next several years	 causing an imbalance in the book of acquiring bank. This can possibly have a contagious effect on its overall book. Secondly	 no bank merger happens smoothly. Any merger comes with its own set of issues at the time of integration. These issues range from the culture of the merging banks	 their business systems in place and own core areas of expertise and geographies. This is especially true in the case of public sector banks	 which are heavily unionised	 where the integration process can be a lot tougher	 unlike in the case of State Bank of India and its subsidiaries	 where work culture and systems in place are the same. Thirdly	 through the merger of two banks	 the government will be only transferring the problem from one entity to another. The steps the government can take to cure the bad loan problem in a particular bank	 such as installing better risk management tools	 bringing in expert agencies or putting in place better management	 can be done even without a merger. In fact	 that can yield faster results since the problem is isolated and easy to identify. In the event of a forced	 bad-loan-driven merger	 should the acquiring bank focus on the integration challenges or containing the bad loan issue? The answer to this question is difficult for any expert banker	 since both issues demand immediate attention. Repairing bad loans is a difficult affair and requires day-to-day monitoring. The handling turns even difficult if bad loans are imported from another bank. It is better to treat stress associated with each banks separately. As Rajan highlighted	 consolidation can happen in the cases of stronger banks	 where there will not be any problems to fix other than the merger itself. Perhaps	 Modi should take a lesson or two from Rajan before hurrying with the bank merger	 if that indeed is a proposal.

Seven things you should know about merger of SBI subordinates  FOR the last couple of months the most debating point in Indian PSU banking realm has been the merger of subordinate banks with SBI. Will the merger of subordinate banks to SBI pave the way for the creation of a strong and effective PSU banking environment in the country? What are the... obstacles on the way of the much-anticipated merger? Here are seven key things you must know about the whole issue. Banks that are up for merger SBI has five associate banks -- State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur	 State Bank of Travancore	 State Bank of Patiala	 State Bank of Mysore and State Bank of Hyderabad. Two of the SBI's subsidiaries had already been merged in the past. The State Bank of Saurashtra in 	 and the State Bank of Indore in  merged with its parent bank. The government-run State Bank of India has five associates -- State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur	 State Bank of Travancore	 State Bank of Patiala	 State Bank of Mysore and State Bank of Hyderabad. Out of these five	 three of them are listed -- State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur	 State Bank of Mysore and State Bank of Travancore. According to finance ministry officials	 State Bank of Patiala is the first in the queue and the bank is set to merge with the parent this fiscal. The reason behind the move Mergers of associates will help SBI gain a reputable position in the global banking system and remain relevant in the emerging economic scenario. None of the Indian banks is among the top global lenders. The Size of SBI is less than one one-sixth of the Bank of America. As per finance ministry	 PSU banks need equity capital infusion of Rs.		 crore by  to be in line with Basel-III norms. Rising stress on public sector lenders due to loan defaulters is a major concern among all banks. NPA (non-performing assets) is a major irritant plaguing the financial health of the PSU banks. Finance Minister Jaitley blames economic slowdown as the main factor behind mounting NPAs. The senior banker said big corporate houses	 notably those in infrastructure business	 were the biggest defaulters. Indian banks' exposure to infrastructure stands at around  percent of the total lending. Government's stand Presenting his maiden national budget presented on July 	 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had hinted at mergers of public sector banks. """"There have been some suggestions for consolidation of public sector banks. Government	 in principle	 agrees to consider these suggestions."""" The finance ministry had recently said they have appointed SBI Capital Markets to undertake a study on mergers as well as recapitalisation of state-owned banks and the report is likely to be finalised within a month. Does govt have any fixed plan about merger? Government says it doesn't have any definite plans for merging PSU banks. Banking Secretary Gurdial Singh Sandhu told CNBC-TV that guidelines on autonomy to PSU banks would be issued in a month. Merger between the ailing United Bank of India and IDBI Bank was a suggestion	 and that United Bank could be a candidate for merger with any other PSU bank as well. What govt is not doing Government is not planning to bring banks under the Companies Act as recommended by the PJ Nayak Committee on governance norms for PSU banks. On the other hand	 Narasimham Committee report pitched for lesser number of banks	 a few which are of an internationally significant size	 some which have a national presence and some which are regional banks. Two of the SBI's subsidiaries had already been merged in the past. The State Bank of Saurashtra in 	 and the State Bank of Indore in  merged with the SBI. A question of scalability and viability The merger is a question of scalability and viability. Additional capital would be required for the merger and such funds would be needed for absorption of costs related to the merger. Problems galore The five associate banks of SBI together have around 	 staff. Each one of them has a different work culture. So the merger is not an easy job. To ensure smooth merger	 the government may opt for one bank at a time. Some experts say that bank with the stronger balance sheet should be given priority. Those that are weaker should be strengthened.

The bank	 which is one of the five associate banks of SBI	 has been seen as a favourite to merge with the countrys largest bank. In a freewheeling discussion with BusinessLine	 Rangan talks about the economy	 the non-performing loan situation and the Jan-Dhan scheme. Edited excerpts:  What is the update on SBPs merger with SBI? Has anything new come about?  As of now	 I think our Chairperson (Arundhati Bhattacharya) has gone on record to say that	 in the immediate future	 it is not happening. So	 it might not happen in this fiscal and may not happen in the next fiscal also. Unless the economy stabilises and banks gain some inner strength	 a merger is not possible. Our Chairperson is very clearIt is not even on the radar for now.  Her predecessor	 Pratip Chaudhuri had gone on record to say that at least one associate bank will merge with SBI by the end of FY . What has changed between then and now?  The financials. All banks have to build up their core strength. Right now the asset quality across banks is in a bad shape. You dont do mergers when the industry is in a bad shape. You may sink together.  The environment seems to be improving. Once the industry comes up	 the asset quality problem gets sorted out. Would I adopt a sick baby and kill it in the ICU? It is not fair. Over the past one year	 the strength of banks has gone down internally. There are pressures	 including additional need for capital	 which the Government cannot give.  Also	 there is additional need for provisioning for assets	 as the largest of the large industries are showing signs of serious trouble.  What do you think are the three things that this new Government has put in place or should put in place that will cause the turnaround that you are talking about?  They have brought in a lot of policy clarity on environmental clearance. With the coal policy	 they are going to auction off the blocks so that the country does not suffer from coal shortage.  They are also bringing in things so that independent power producers get their projects back on track. They are also facilitating completion of many road projects. If they bring the power and road projects back on track	 the economy will improve. The rest are derivative industries.  What is the NPA situation for your bank?  Our overall NPA (non-performing asset) situation is a bit on the negative side. At . per cent plus (of total loans)	 it is not very good and we have to bring it down.  Most of the slippages are in the corporate sector and we cannot do much there because in corporate lending we have to follow the leaders. In the farm	 SME	 and retail sectors our NPAs have come down over the  levels in percentage terms. So	 that is the positive side.  So	 what are you doing to improve the banks NPA situation?  We are focussing on recoveries more. We are also restructuring some assets and we will also look at asset sale to some asset restructuring companies.  What has been your progress on the Jan-Dhan front?  We have opened about eight lakh accounts	 and six lakh RuPay cards have been issued for these. The remaining account holders too will be issued  the cards.  How does the Jan-Dhan scheme differ from the Direct Benefit Transfer scheme where banks also went after opening the accounts?  In this scheme	 it is the banks job to get a bank account irrespective of Aadhaar (unique identification number). Initially it was a compulsionnow I dont think it is a compulsion.  I see it is a good business proposition. Though for now it is on a cost basis	 but the profit will come over a period of time because my investment is only one-time. If I open an account for an individual	 he becomes my customer for life. A savings bank customer	 especially in villages	 remains a customer for life.  We will link other products to the account. It is an investment. It has not really (negatively) impacted the bottomline of my bank.

However	 Kannan declined to comment about old speculation that associate banks would be merged with the main parent bank State Bank of India (SBI).

The finance ministry has sent a letter to all PSBs asking them to provide business and financial details within a month to SBI Capital Markets	 the investment bank that has been mandated to present possible and viable scenarios for bank consolidation. """"There were some banks which were reluctant on sharing their business details with an outside agency and perhaps that is why the ministry had intervened	 said a senior banker with knowledge of the matter.  Earlier	 financial services secretary GS Sandhu had said that the government has asked SBI Caps to do a study on bank consolidation. """"We have given them two assignments	 one is on the recapitalisation and other on bank consolidation	 he had said. According to him	 there had been various suggestions on the matter. The finance ministry's push comes at a time when the country's largest bank	 State Bank of India	 has put on hold its plan to merge any of its five associate banks.  """"The government wants some movement on consolidation. Since SBI has not announced any plans	 it (government) is trying to push smaller banks	 said an executive director of a state-run bank.  Of SBI's associate banks	 State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur	 State Bank of Mysore and State Bank of Travancore are listed entities. The country's largest lender was touted to merge either State Bank of Patiala or State Bank of Hyderabad with it in this financial year.  SBI has estimated Rs 	 crore as total capital requirement under the Basel III capital adequacy framework for all of SBI's associate banks. Indian banks need to meet the Basel III guidelines in phases through -.  The government is keen that at least some preparatory framework is set up on consolidation in state-run banks given the huge fund requirements to meet the global guidelines. Consolidation is expected to increase the competitiveness of Indian banks globally and also ensure financial stability. It may become easier for the merged entities to raise resource. In his budget speech	 finance minister Arun Jaitley had said that the government had received some suggestions for consolidation of PSBs. """"Government	 in principle	 agrees to consider these suggestions	 he had said. As per the ministry's estimates	 state-run banks require Rs . lakh crore as equity by  to meet capital requirements. The government has allocated a relatively paltryRs 	 crore for bank capitalisation in this fiscal year through March .  """"There are some broad parameters within which the banks should explore all options. The report on consolidation will help to set up a road map for merger in PSBs	 said a finance ministry official	 adding that any merger proposals will be evaluated on the parameters of pan-India presence	 business and information technology integration.  The government intends to keep its holding in PSBs at a minimum %. It has asked them to hive-off noncore businesses	 such as insurance	 or get them listed to raise resources.""

It is more or less confirmed that a Cabinet nod will be required to help government reduce its stake in public sector banks and most it is likely to be a blanket approval.

As far as current shareholding of government in various banks in concerned	 in Canara Bank according to June  quarterly results	 the promoter shareholding is  percent . In case of  State Bank of India (SBI) or  Punjab National Bank (PNB) it is around . percent and . percent respectively.

It will all be done in tranches and this is going to be an approval for a four year roadmap.

The ministry is expected to soon hold a meeting with all state-run banks to discuss issues related to their operations	 their contribution to the economy and coordination with other arms of the government.   The issue of consolidation will also be discussed at this meeting	 a senior finance ministry official said	 adding that any merger proposal will be evaluated on the parameters of pan-India presence	 business and information technology integration.   """"The government has limited capital to offer and it has to be deployed judiciously	 the official said on condition of anonymity. The government will draw the road map for bank capitalisation on the basis of performance of the banks in the second quarter of the current fiscal	 the official added.   According to the ministry's estimates	 state-run banks require Rs . lakh crore as equity by  to meet the global Basel III capital norms. But the government has allocated a relatively paltry Rs 	 crore for bank capitalisation in this fiscal.  """"If some bank has viable merger proposal we can allocate more resources towards that to support its plan	 the official added. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said in his budget speech that the government had received some suggestions for consolidation of public sector banks. """"Government	 in principle	 agrees to consider these suggestions	 he had noted.   The official cited earlier said	 """"A best case scenario will be where the merged entities have a pan-India presence	 no conflicting subsidiary and fairly equal business mix.""""   The merger process can kick off with the country's largest bank	 State Bank of India	 taking over one of its subsidiaries. The bank has estimated Rs 	 crore as total capital requirement under the Basel III capital adequacy framework for all of SBI's subsidiary banks from - to -.   A chairman of a state-run bank said that most banks would not be interested in merger at this juncture when the bad loans in the system have peaked.   """"Why should we take over a bank such as United Bank of India	 which is struggling	 unless the rewards are much higher than the risk?"""" he asked	 requesting anonymity.   The gross non-performing assets of staterun banks touched Rs . lakh crore at the end of March	 an increase of  per cent over the previous fiscal.   The government intends to keep its holding in public sector banks at  per cent. It has also asked these banks to hive off their non-core businesses such as insurance or get them listed to raise resources.""

A look at how SBI is preparing to be State Bank of World As government plans to merge all associate banks with SBI and make the countrys biggest bank a global player	 a look at how the game is panning out  All may not be right and bright with the world	 and Indian economy	 but the UPA government is going full steam ahead. Stung by China	 which in a decade or so has seen four of its banks in the list of top- biggest global banks	 the Manmohan-Chidambaram team is now pushing for creation of an Indian banking behemoth to rub shoulders with the global banking giants.  The idea	 say experts	 is to enhance Indias role in the Western financial markets.  Not quite surprisingly	 the need for restructuring of banks was felt soon after India liberalized its economy in 	 under finance minister Manmohan Singh. And it is under P Chidambarams watch as the finance minister that India is feeling the need for two or three world-sized banks in an economy that is poised to become one among the five largest in the world	 as he put it in May this year.  Ergo	 the decision to make the State Bank of India (SBI)	 the countrys biggest bank by a long	 long margin with over 	 branches	 play a bigger role  globally.  So by the end of this month	 SBI is expected to announce merger of one of its associate banks with the parent institution. In line are five associate SBI banks: State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur (headquartered in Jaipur)	 State Bank of Hyderabad (Hyderabad)	 State Bank of Mysore (Bangalore)	 State Bank of Patiala (Patiala) and State Bank of Travancore (with Thiruvananthapuram as headquarters)	 expected to be part of the giant called SBI in the next  years. This was recommended by various committees since  (and) one of the first candidates would be the SBI. It should merge conceptually and thereby bring a lot of efficiency in operations to serve as the global bank for Indian export and import firms. They (SBI) need to do a lot of thinking and reorganisation to make global operations more profitable	 says DK Mittal	 former secretary	 department of financial services	 under whose tenure the government brought out a blueprint on the functional improvement in the operations of public sector banks (PSBs)	 including the option for merger.   Having retired in February 	 Mittal had written to the head of PSBs about improving their administration and performance.  That the game is on well and truly was borne out by the Reserve Bank of Indias (RBI) decision in August to issue a discussion paper on indicative reorientation of the banking structure. In the paper	 the banking regulator suggests creation of three or four very large banks. The desire to find a place in the global list for Indian banks probably emerges as we increasingly integrate with the global economy and progress to fuller capital account convertibility	 says the -page discussion paper	 titled Banking Structure in India: The Way Forward.  Globalisation of Indian banks	 the paper says	 would further integrate Indian economy with the vicissitudes of global finance	 exposing it thereby to higher degrees of contagion and external sources of systemic risks.  Formed in  through parliament statue (SBI Subsidiary Banks Act	 )	 these associate banks are area specific banks with strong geographical importance in the state. Having headquarters in Bangalore	 Thiruvananthapuram	 Hyderabad	 Jaipur and Patiala	 these banks have overwhelming presence in the area.  So how will the ambitious idea work out? The government plans to merge one of these associate banks every two years	 leading to a complete merger	 and consolidation of banking business	 over the next  years. Consolidation in the banking sector may pave the way for stronger institutions with the capacity to meet corporate and infrastructure funding needs	 the RBI paper explains. According to the th five-year plan	 India needs investments worth $ trillion only to scale up its infrastructure.  The governments logic of creating a banking behemoth in SBI has	 however	 not struck a chord with employees associations in the industry. The All-India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA)	 the countrys biggest such union	 and the Bank Employees Federation of India (BEFI) have already called a day-long bank strike on September  to protest the move. That comes close on the heels of the anti-merger day observed by these unions on September .  We strongly protest against any such proposal of closing down the associate banks and (being taken) over by SBI	 AIBEA says in a letter to the finance minister. There is no demand from employees	 depositors	 borrowers	 the general public and even shareholders for merger of the associate banks with SBI. Then why (plan) such a merger?  Jyoti Prakash Gadia	 convener of the panel on banking and finance at industry lobby Confederation of Indian Industry (CII)	 also says the idea might sound good on paper but is not that great when implemented because there have been problems with the merger of banks globally	 and there is constant apprehension of such big banks failing	 and leaving the economy doddering.  Need to create banking giant  While the idea may not exactly be oven-fresh	 the finance minister gave it momentum. Mergers may reduce competition in certain segments or geographies substantially and may alter competition between banks and non-banks	 he said in the inaugural lecture on the annual day of the Competition Commission of India (CCI) in May.  Raising concern about the position of Indian banks	 RBI followed suit. Since 	 Indian economy has grown manifold and there has been progressive liberalisation and globalisation. During this period the number of new commercial banks licensed is only  and none of the Indian banks has acquired the size and reach on a global scale	 says the RBI paper.  No Indian bank can compete with any global bank	 says Pradeep Shankar	 former managing director of State Bank of Indore.  His contention is seconded by rankings accorded by Brand Directory	 which is quoted by the RBI paper: only one Indian bank figures among the  biggest banks of the world  SBI	 ranked at . While ICICI Bank is  and HDFC Bank 	 the second best among PSU banks is Punjab National Bank (PNB)	 ranked a poor 	 followed by Bank of Baroda (BoB) at .  In contrast are the Chinese banks	 which are moving up the ladder at a stupendous pace. According to the latest report in Banker	 a trade publication of the renowned British magazine	 The Economist	 the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) has topped the worlds banking list by market capitalization for   a first for a Chinese bank. According to data available	 ICBC has  overseas branches in  countries and regions.  Besides	 as many as three other Chinese banks  China Construction Bank	 Bank of China and Agriculture Bank of China  are among the worlds top  biggest banks	 the Banker says. Three decades ago	 China created all four banks from its central bank	 Peoples Bank of China	 and the ascension has been at an enviable clip since. In early 	 the report says	 ICBC was ranked an also-ran nd among the worlds top 	 banks  incidentally	 nearly the same position the SBI enjoys today.  While the RBI paper on banking reforms gives the system a pat on the back  financial soundness of the Indian commercial banking system compares favourably with most advanced and emerging countries	 it says  challenges nevertheless lie ahead. Like the Indian banking system withstood the  global financial crisis	 which tumbled the banking system of many western countries	 experts also point out that the ongoing move to implement Basel-III norms in parts since April  (see box for what Basel-III norms are) would necessitate certain changes. It is viewed that banks have to realign their businesses for optimisation of core capital to implement these norms	 which are a set of international banking regulations and are to be fully put into action by March 	 .  In that case	 smaller banks will need a lot of capital infusion. According to D Subbarao	 the RBI governor till recently	 Indian banks will need to raise as much as Rs . trillion to meet Basel-III norms by . This also includes Rs . trillion as non-equity capital and Rs . trillion in equity capital over the next five years.  The banks also need capitalisation to meet their enhanced lending	 which is increasing every year. So you need consolidation among banks. There is a need for merger because smaller banks with large NPAs cant sustain	 senior business and finance journalist Alam Srinivas says. Associate banks	 or even smaller banks	 cant survive on their own in future.  Nirupama Soundararajan	 additional director of the industry chamber FICCIs committee on banking and financial institutions	 elaborates the same point: If smaller banks are merged into the big banks	 the cost will be absorbed by the parent bank.  Asked about the observation that SBI	 if and when it becomes a banking giant	 would find it difficult to get a footing in overbanked western economies	 Soundararajan shrugs off the suggestion. Indian banks can tap two important sectors by going global. The first is the NRI community	 which wants to put money into banks	 especially Indian banks. (The second group is) Indian industries that are going abroad  Indian banks would be the natural choice of doing transactions (for these companies)	 she adds.  Merger: concerns and apprehensions  In  years of Indias banking history	 Punjab National Bank (PNB) has seen seven mergers  the most for any Indian bank. But the first time a public sector bank was merged with another came on September 		 when New Bank of India (NBI) merged with PNB. Bleeding with heavy losses	 non-performing assets (NPAs) of NBI were  percent of the banks total assets at the time of the merger.  But it was far from a smooth transition. The business figure of NBI was equivalent to five or six big branches of PNB and staff productivity was very low. The NBI did not even have advanced technology	 says CS Jog	 former general manager (credit) at PNB who was involved in the merger operations. Looking at the forthcoming merger plans of SBI from his own experience at the PNB-NBI merger	 Jog says adjusting human resources is the biggest problem in a merger	 though there are also cultural and working predicaments as well.  For eight years	 the NBI employees were not promoted  they felt they had been victimised	 Jog recalls. In 	 about four years since the merger	 the number of NBI branches was reduced from  to  to avoid duplicating branches in the same area.  The next government-owned bank was merged only after  years	 when State Bank of Saurashtra was merged with SBI in . While the Left parties raised objection to the merger	 the Lok Sabha put its seal on the decision: the bills to repeal the State Bank of Saurashtra Act and amend the SBI (Subsidiary Banks) Act were passed by voice vote in parliament in .  In 	 State Bank of Indore was merged with SBI with the cabinets approval. After that	 staff benefit cost delayed the merger of associate banks with SBI. There are three terminal benefits  gratuity	 pension and provident fund  for SBI employees compared to two (gratuity and pension) for the staff in associate banks.  Experts also point out the fact that a merger is likely to be helpful and less challenging if both banks in question use the same technology	 which holds true for SBI and its associate banks. So there will be no problem if these banks are merged	 says P Sudhakar	 former general-secretary of Associate Bank Officers Association (ABOA) who retired recently from State Bank of Hyderabad. The only problem SBI will face in merging with its associates is from SBT	 because the bank has lots of litigations.  SBT	 as also State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur and State Bank of Mysore	 would take additional time in merging with the SBI because all three banks are listed entities	 with non-promoter holding ranging between . percent and  percent.  The State Bank of Hyderabad and State Bank of Patiala are fully owned by SBI.  Merger: contrarian view  While the SBIs merger process with its associate banks is said to cost the government about Rs 	 crore	 Sudhakar	 says that shouldnt be a huge problem. First	 the government is not going ahead with the merger of banks in one go	 and second	 there are secret reserves (contingency fund) with the bank which can take care of merger.  But experts say the time is not ripe for the SBI to go international. Before Lehman Brothers (US banking giant that declared bankruptcy in  and precipitated the crisis in that market)	 mergers were the hot debate (in banking circles). There was the suggestion that there should be top banks in India. But there is always a chance of big banks failing and harming the economy	 says Gadia of CII.  Experts also say the government will have to be careful with the merger process. Every bank has got its business stronghold (in different regions of the country). If a bank is strong in western India and merges with two or three small banks of the same region	 will the mergers be called successful? Will it really serve the purpose of merger? Jog asks.  When you merge banks it will only increase the size of the balance sheet	 he says. When you go international what about your social commitments?  Soundararajan counters: The global operational profit can be utilised in meeting financial inclusion schemes and taking banking to unbanked areas. Our economy can only benefit from that. But amid the big debate between yeas and nays	 the merger will take time in India.  ...  The -minute capsule Where Indian banks stand in global league  State Bank of India:  ICICI Bank:  HDFC Bank:  Axis Bank:  Punjab National Bank:  Bank of Baroda:    RBI paper on consolidation of banks  Pros   Consolidation may facilitate geographical diversification and access to new markets Big banks are usually expected to create standardised mass-market financial products Transaction costs and risks associated with financing of small businesses may be high for small banks. Large and consolidated banks can mitigate costs better and lend to these sectors Cons  Consolidated banks may rather cater to big-ticket businesses	 and in the process adversely affect financial inclusion On globalisation	 an opposing view is that instead of looking outwards	 Indian banks should look inwards by scaling financial deepening. Banking on behemoth? What experts say  DK Mittal (former secretary	 department of financial services): Merger will become inevitable if the economy remains so (in crisis). NPAs will then touch about -% (from the present -%). In that case	 either the good banks or the government would have to bail out the bad banks. This situation	 rather than politics or pressure from trade unions	 will force PSBs to merge among themselves.  Nirupama Soundararajan (additional director	 FICCI committee on banking and financial institutions): There can be quid pro quo  if other countries do not let Indian banks to work	 then there can be agreement with that country: you open a bank here	 and Indian banks will do the same.  Pradeep Shankar (former MD	 State Bank of Indore): Consolidation in banking sector may pave way for stronger financial institutions with capacity to meet corporate infrastructure funding needs. Like in the case of Tata buying Corus	 Indian banks can chip with the funding.  Jyoti Prakash Gadia (convener	 CII panel on banking and finance): If big banks fail	 it will hurt the economy. Failure of small banks will not hurt much. Recent trend says big banks are failing often.  CS Jog (former general manager-credit	 PNB): There are restrictions in operating in other countries. Getting a banking foothhold in the West is not easy	 as new licences are not easily given. Most western countries have got strict regulators."""

One	 of course	 the State Bank of India (SBI) with one of their subsidiaries. (We are) working on that	 he said. Talks have been on for long to merge SBI's subsidiaries with the parent bank.

In an interaction with BusinessLine	 SA Ramesh Rangan	 Managing Director of State Bank of Patiala	 spoke about the banks merger plans	 balance sheet	 bad debts and other issues. Edited excerpts:  What is the current status of the banks merger plans?  Right now there are five associate banks or subsidiaries of SBI	 (State Bank of Hyderabad	 State Bank of Mysore	 State Bank of Travancore	 State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur and State Bank of Patiala). Of these	 three are public-owned	 while two (Hyderabad and Patiala) are fully owned by SBI.  Merger is very much in the offing now. It was not so about six months ago. The reason why it (merger) is done over a staggered period is the need for capital by the parent bank as well as by its associates. We also have to bring in capital. Obviously	 a merger will take place only if there is value.  Basically	 our bank	 along with SBI	 is trying to strengthen the internal balance sheets	 after which a merger will definitely take place at an appropriate time. I personally believe that the merger will create a strong bank. But	 for that	 the arms of the bank need to be made stronger	 which is what we are doing now.  Last year	 SBI infused capital in our bank so that when it is eventually merged it will be good for both the organisations.  What is the time line for the merger?  My Chairperson has already gone on record to say that one bank will probably be merged this financial year.  Will that be the State Bank of Patiala?  Not necessarily. We have not been told about that. It could be one of those (five) banks and could even be one of the listed ones.  Are there any plans of your bank going public?  If the question of merger arises	 listing will not be required.""																																																																																																																																			"

One of the five associate banks of the country's top lender	 the State Bank of India (SBI)	 is set to merge with the parent this fiscal. State Bank of Patiala is the most likely suitor	 a top banker has said.  """"We have no issue with a merger. We are ready for it	 said managing director of State Bank of Patiala S.A. Ramesh Rangan.

He also said banks must be recapitalised and strengthened before a take-over.  Asked which associates of SBI should be given priority	 Rangan said: """"I personally feel the bank with the stronger balance sheet should be given priority. Those that are weaker should be strengthened.""""  Two of the SBI's subsidiaries had already been merged in the past. The State Bank of Saurashtra in 	 and the State Bank of Indore in .  Rangan said mergers of associates will help SBI gain a reputable position in the global banking system and remain relevant in the emerging economic scenario. None of the Indian banks is among the top global lenders.  The Size of SBI is less than one one-sixth of the Bank of America.  Rangan	 who had also worked in the finance ministry in a senior position	 said consolidation would help Indian lenders raise required funds for expansion.  According to the finance ministry	 public sector banks need equity capital infusion of Rs.		 crore by  to be in line with Basel-III norms. Rising stress on public sector lenders due to loan defaulters is a major concern among all banks.  """"All commercial banks's financials are under stress. Non-performing assets have risen sharply in the past five years. I am hopeful that the things would improve gradually in the coming years with the revival in the economy	 he said.  The senior banker said big corporate houses	 notably those in infrastructure business	 were the biggest defaulters. Indian banks' exposure to infrastructure stands at around  percent of the total lending.  """"Majority of infrastructure projects have been delayed due environmental clearances and some other issue. We hope	 the things will move faster under the new government.""""""																																																																																																																										"

That makes one wonder whether how many of them make money. It could be a fair bet that most of them don't. Even if all of them do	 the question is this: Can't one branch do in place of five? The State Bank of India and its associates may justify a call for amalgamation of the associates with the parent because of overlap. But can that logic be extended to public sector banks in general forcing the merger of smaller ones with the big to create a bigger entity? Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan plans to give bank licences on tap. There is a plan to have differentiated bank licences which will help take financial services to nearly two-thirds of the population which does not have access to it. But the government is	 in principle	 comfortable with merging some staterun banks	 though it has not spelt out how it plans to go about it. Is it not a contradictory argument by the two most powerful arms of administration for more banks to achieve financial inclusion and	 at the same time	 talk about a reduction in the number of banks? What are the arguments for creating bigger banks through mergers? Many of them are inefficient	 financially weak and are not able to scale up their businesses in a meaningful way. A merger can lead to the new management shuttering many branches	 re-allocating resources to improve productivity and deliver profits. Data across the globe show that mergers and acquisitions hardly deliver the results that they are supposed to - be it in automobiles or in financial services. Daimler Chrysler and Citigroup are monumental examples of how mergers could be disastrous. India's state-run banks	 in general	 have a regional character. Most of these were run by the dominant business groups of the region such as Indian Overseas Bank by the Chettiars of Tamil Nadu or the Bank of Baroda founded by Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad	 before nationalisation. To forcibly give a national character to these institutions through mergers of banks from regions where these dominant ones do not have a presence	 may even backfire. The study of IDBI Bank's amalgamation with United Western Bank should show what's in store with mergers. Political and bureaucratic interference is the biggest drag on PSU banks. Between October  and January 	 the finance ministry issued  circulars to banks	 putting even schools to shame. That must end. Also	 for all practical purposes  be it hiring or wage negotiations  PSU banks are a monolithic entity than companies competing in the market place to grab business. The PJ Nayak Committee identifies the problem with these banks. """"The Government and RBI need to move to first remove the external constraints imposed upon them	 so that these banks are not disadvantaged in relation to private sector banks	 which are uninhibited by them."""" There is a tendency to compare with China for nearly everything. Its ICBC and Agriculture Bank of China are cited to show how tiny Indian banks are. But the story is that they grew bigger as the economy grew. China still has  government-owned banks. Russia has . There is no reason why India cannot have  state-owned banks. Almost all Indian banks can get back to life provided they realise that their strength lies in doing well in their chosen region	 than trying to imitate the bigger ones and attempt to open branches to please political masters even if there is no business. This may be the best time for the government to step aside from actively managing the banks. Banks need capital	 and the dominant shareholder does not have much of it. Let the banks raise private capital to the extent that government ownership falls to %. Implement some recommendations of Nayak panel such as a five-year term for the chairman. Let every bank have its own wage structure. If more automobile companies such as Maruti Suzuki	 Hyundai	 General Motors	 Toyota and Ford have led to superior customer experience	 there is no reason to believe that it could be different when it comes to banking.""

Four big state-run banks  State Bank of India	 Punjab National Bank	 Bank of Baroda and Bank of India  have already begun an exercise to identify takeover targets to gain access to franchises that would augment their capabilities	 said three top bankers familiar with the move.  The top managements of the four banks are in the process of preparing a blueprint that would explain the rationale for absorbing one or two entities	 said the people cited above	 none of whom wanted to be named.   Employees at these state-run banks are engaged in the exercise after finance minister Arun Jaitley gave the lenders the go-ahead to decide how they would strategise to remain relevant in the emerging economic scenario.  """"We are hearing from the corridors of finance ministry that there is seriousness on consolidation of banks	 said an executive from one of the top four banks.   """"The sense we are getting is that first there could be merger of at least one SBI associate bank with SBI to kick off the consolidation process.""""   Although no names of likely acquisition targets are being discussed at these four banks	 the key conditions for a smaller bank will be regional	 technological and cultural advantages.   For instance	 a bank such as Bank of Baroda	 which does not have a presence in the East	 may prefer one from that part of the country.   State-run banks have weakened over the years as governments have treated them as an organ of the administration and used them to push their social agenda.   Meanwhile	 lenders in neighbouring China have acquired scale while those in India are puny by comparison	 giving them little clout in global markets. The economic downturn	 with growth having almost halved from the peak	 has exposed the fault lines in the system.   The parlous financial position of the government has left banks capitalstarved  the allocation for this year is tiny compared with the amount needed to meet Basel III standards. And	 to access capital from the market	 the staterun banks need a strategy to turn more profitable. Currently	 they are labouring under bad debt on account of companies finding it difficult to repay loans because of the slump.   """"Government has made it clear that they will not give any capital	 said one of the bankers. """"Banks that have the capital and the capability to raise capital could look at acquisitions	 he said	 while adding """"Nothing has reached the drawing board. Banks are only doing all kinds of permutations and combinations.""""   To be sure	 state-run bank consolidation has been discussed for nearly a decade	 but little progress has been made	 except for shotgun weddings that were aimed at rescuing ventures in poor shape. Inertia among banks	 cultural issues and fears of trade union unrest held up any such move. That may now change with the new government. """"There have been some suggestions for consolidation of public sector banks	 Jaitley said in his July  Budget speech. """"Government	 in principle	 agrees to consider these suggestions.""""   A committee set up by the Reserve Bank of India under former Axis Bank chairman PJ Nayak had suggested that the health of state-run banks was poor. To strengthen them	 the report said it will be better """"either to privatise these banks and allow their future solvency to be subject to market competition	 including through mergers; or to design a radically new governance structure for these banks which would better ensure their ability to compete successfully	 in order that repeated claims for capital support from the government	 unconnected with market returns	 are avoided.""""   The market share of the public sector banks is forecast to decline from % in  to just over % in 	 Nayak had said. They stack up poorly in many respects against non-state institutions.   For instance	 net profit per employee at the new private sector banks was about four times that of the SBI Group in the year ended March .

Losing cultural identity is a very tough thing. It is like two states merging. Can that happen? asked Ramesh Rangan	 managing director of State Bank of Patiala (SBP). Mergers have to come from within	 as merging of two different cultures is not easy.  There have been reports suggesting that SBP will be the first of the associate banks to be merged with the nations biggest lender	 State Bank of India	 in this round.  Two associates  State Bank of Saurashtra and State Bank of Indore  have already been merged with SBI. One more may be merged this financial year.  The work culture varies from bank to bank	 making merger of staff very difficult	 Rangan told Financial Chronicle. He said technology is the least of the worries	 but even that might cost a bit.  Rangan said he was not aware of the process to merge SBP with SBI. I have not been approached for merger of our bank with SBI so far	 he said	 but clarified that he had no issue if SBP was taken up for merger.  Rangan said the bank has to be recapitalised in the first step. Last year SBP was provided about Rs -odd crore for recapitalisation by State Bank of India	 and it is expecting an equal amount this year.  My bank does not require Rs 	 crore or Rs 	 crore for recapitalisation	 and the money required is peanuts for SBI	 Rangan said. He insisted that any merger must happen from a position of strength. We have to strengthen associates first and then merge.  The plan is to merge all the associate banks with SBI over the next few years to create a banking giant	 whose market share would rise to  per cent from  per cent at present. Along with State Bank of Patiala	 others in the line are State Bank of Hyderabad	 State Bank of Jaipur and Bikaner	 State Bank of Travancore and State Bank of Mysore.  SBI will become a big bank	 but it will still be nowhere near large Japanese or Chinese banks	 which have huge capital. India needs large banks	 Rangan said.  The central bank last week said it would start announcing too-big-to-fail banks in August  and SBI	 ICICI Bank	 HDFC Bank	 Axis Bank	 Punjab National Bank and Bank of Baroda are in the reckoning to be declared systemically important.  On the challenges for the banking system	 Rangan said non-performing assets were an industry-wide problem and it was partly due to the large infrastructure projects. Once these projects are put on track	 supporting industries like steel	 petroleum	 plastics would pick up and revive the slowing economy	 he felt.  Domestic banks exposure to the infrastructure sector stands at  per cent of total lending	 which is too high. Unfortunately the bond market has not developed in the country to support the fund requirement	 something the government tried to address in the budget.  India needs at least one large development financial institution (DFI) for infrastructure funding. All over the world	 including advanced economies like Germany	 there are DFIs which make it easy to raise long-term capital	 Rangan said	 but stopped short of saying that winding up Indias own DFIs was a mistake.  There are very few takers for long-term deposits in commercial banks	 which by nature and by rules have access only to short- and medium-term capital. Long-term lending to infrastructure projects resulted in the asset-liability mismatch	 he said.  Banks have welcomed the announcement of infrastructure bonds in the budget	 as they would attract high net worth individuals into infra funding.  State Bank of Patiala has not yet decided on floating such bonds	 but might come out with a small issue this financial year	 Rangan said.""

This is	 however	 expected to be preceded by State Bank of India taking its subsidiary State Bank of Patiala into its fold.   While the finance ministry and state-run banks are looking at other merger options	 work on these two proposals has already started	 top-level government sources said. On June 	 TOI was the first to report that the government had begun consultations on consolidation of public sector banks.   There are  state-run banks in the country	 including five SBI subsidiaries. The government is keen to bolster the weaker entities but has asked banks to prepare a blueprint keeping in mind human resource issues	 geographical spread and technology platforms.While the match-making exercise is so far confined to only four banks	 sources said the wider consolidation plan would focus on regional synergies. For instance	 Dena Bank may be allowed to merge with Punjab National Bank	 while Oriental Bank of Commerce may be headed for integration with Bank of India. Although the proposals are only at preliminary discussion stage	 Bank of Baroda	 Canara Bank and Union Bank of India have been identified as potential acquirers for the weaker entities. As a result	 sources said that United Bank of India's merger with IDBI Bank made perfect sense. IDBI has a weak presence in the eastern part of the country where UBI has a strong branch network. Besides	 IDBI Bank is seen to have a weak retail network	 which can be strengthened by the Kolkata-headquartered lender. In addition	 both the banks use common software	 Infosys' Finacle	 which will make the merger easier.   But there are some major hurdles that will need to be overcome. IDBI Bank	 for instance	 is governed by a different pay scale than other nationalized banks which follow the Indian Banks' Association-negotiated structure. If the proposal goes through	 this will be the first merger in the nationalized bank space since Punjab National Bank's takeover of New Bank of India   In contrast	 State Bank of Patiala employees will gain from the merger with SBI as they will entitled to more benefits. SBI has already merged two of its subsidiaries - State Bank of Saurashtra and State Bank of Indore - as part of an exercise to reduce the pressure on capital and bring about synergies. Now	 the sources said	 the focus is on the northern region.   When contacted	 IDBI Bank chairman and managing director MS Raghvan said	 """"Nothing has emerged."""" An executive at United Bank said that there has been discussion around how the consolidation exercise should be driven but the bank had not been asked to prepare a blueprint.   SBI chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya could not be reached for comment but in a recent interview she had backed the idea of merger of subsidiaries.""

Presenting the Union Budget for - on Thursday	 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said the government has agreed in principle to consider suggestions for consolidation of public sector banks.

Ekta: One of the key expectations that have been spoken about is the possibility of a merger of SBI subsidiaries with SBI itself. Having worked as the CMD of SBI	 this must have come up multiple times as an issue while you were the chairman. What would be the impediments to something like this and what would be the feasibility of this? A: There are no impediments; the economic rationale for a merger is very strong	 only thing it needs to be spaced out because if there are five associate banks and if all of them are merged in one go then it could lead to lot of destabilisation particularly the human resource (HR) angel. Therefore	 one merger in every two years would be a good frequency and we need no come through the Budget itself because this is a different administrative process or a business process and so	 it need not necessarily be linked to the Budget but on the larger issue of concern there is a case for consolidation among larger public sector banks and even some of the private sector banks because the Indian banking space is too fragmented. Ekta: One of the things that you did bring up is that the possibility of employees or unions going against a merger	 would that be a significant issue if in case there is only a statement of intent? A: They are not against merger because when you do a merger	 the compensation structure of associate banks is lower than that of the parent bank. So even at the time of the previous two mergers	 there is an economic cost to that and that economic cost at current scenario is between Rs 	 crore and Rs 	 crore per bank. So is it right to load it all in one year? Secondly	 if you look at merging State Bank of Hyderabad with State Bank of India (SBI) then in Andhra Pradesh	 there would be 	 branches. Now you leave the particular apparatus	 currently	 we have one local head office at Hyderabad but then it needs to be spaced out responding to the political aspirations of different regions	 you need to create different local head offices and others. So there are whole lot of administrative and staff issues. I am not suggesting that the staff is opposed to this but some rationalisation is required.

A senior official from the bank said	 According to an internal assessment about Rs 	 crore is required for the merger of one associate bank to itself and it takes about a year to reorganise and rehabilitate the employees. Capital will be a key concern for the bank as it will also have to set aside funds for growth and expansion.  Most of SBIs associate banks are regional players with the focus on smaller geographies. Amalgamating such banks requires their employees to reorient themselves to SBIs pan-India presence and be prepared to work anywhere in the country. This is a major problem as employees do not want to be transferred from their locations. We are still grappling with issues of the previous merger of associate banks	 the official said.  In a first	 SBI merged State Bank of Saurashtra with itself in 	 followed by State Bank of Indore in August .  SBIs five associates are State Bank of Travancore	 State Bank of Hyderabad	 State Bank of Patiala	 State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur and State Bank of Mysore. Of this	 State Bank of Hyderabad and State Bank of Patiala are unlisted entities.  Another SBI official	 The unions and the senior management are on the same page as far as mergers are concerned. Chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya has amicable relations with the unions and takes them on board on all merger discussions. Both the officials did not want to be identified by name.  The second official recalled that while previous chairman Pradip Chaudhury had taken the unions to court	 many of those cases were being amicably sorted out now. Unions also realise that young employees have aspirations and to accommodate this they too need to readjust for the inevitable realities. There is a lot more of awareness among the unions than we credit them for. They need to change with the evolving situation in order to stay relevant	 the official said.  SBI issued a clarification to Bombay Stock Exchange after The Economic Times quoted the banks chairman last week suggesting that the time was ripe for merger of all the associate banks. SBI clarified to BSE	 The bank always had plans to consider merger of the associate banks	 eventually	 a position which has been stated by the bank from time to time since long.
